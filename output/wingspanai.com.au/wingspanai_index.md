1\. 24/7 "Team Member" for Less Than a Coffee

Cost comparison: Most SMEs spend $5–$7 on a single sit-down coffee. For under $10, you get a fully-fledged AI Assistant handling chat, voice, lead capture, appointment bookings and support—around the clock. What's the cost of one missed sale?

2\. Labor Savings vs. a Human Hire

Typical entry-level CSR wage in Australia: ~$25–$30/hr.

Just 30 minutes/day of human-agent work replaced saves you ~$12.50–$15/day—already matching your $10/day spend, with zero HR overhead, no training, and no sick days.

3\. Revenue Lift from Even One Extra Lead

Conservative estimate: An SME that converts 1 more lead/week at a $200 average sale nets $800/mo.

That single extra sale covers the entire $300/mo for your AI Assistant—and all subsequent leads are pure upside.
