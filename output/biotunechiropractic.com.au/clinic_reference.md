## 2. Clinical Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### General Chiropractic Care
* **Sensation:** Adjustments are generally gentle and well-tolerated. Soft tissue work may involve mild discomfort depending on patient sensitivity.
* **Chiropractic vs. Physiotherapy:** Chiropractors focus on spinal alignment, joint function, hands-on adjustments, and ergonomics. Physiotherapists typically focus on exercise-based rehabilitation.
* **Care Plans:** Treatment frequency is individualized based on posture, health goals, and how the body responds to care.
* **Post-Session Expectations:** Some patients may experience mild soreness, tenderness, or bruising (specifically after dry needling), which usually resolves within a few days.

### Specialized Techniques
* **ABC™ (Advanced BioStructural Correction):** A structural alignment approach focusing on posture and natural balance. It is considered gentle and comfortable.
* **ECC™ (Endonasal Cranial Correction):** Involves brief pressure in the nasal area to restore balance. A health history assessment is required before this is recommended.

### Dry Needling Information
* **Acupuncture vs. Dry Needling:** Acupuncture is rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine (energy balance). Dry Needling is a musculoskeletal technique targeting myofascial trigger points to reduce muscle tension.
* **Safety & Contraindications:** Not suitable for individuals with bleeding disorders, active infections, or open wounds. Extra care is taken for those with needle phobias or allergies.
* **Recovery:** Most patients can continue with daily activities immediately following a session.
