FREQUENTLY ASKED **QUESTIONS**
------------------------------

[Are chiropractic adjustments safe?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/#toggle-1)

Absolutely. Long term research shows that joint manipulation is one of the safest approaches for relieving pain compared to many different medical approaches.

[Why is there a click when I have an adjustment?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/#toggle-2)

When you have an adjustment, a gas bubble can sometimes be released within the joint space. The great thing about this is it relaxes muscles around the joint and increases how far it moves. This may need to be repeated a few times in succession to get the joint to return to its normal, fully mobile state.

[Why do adjustments need to be done?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/#toggle-3)

Bad posture, constant heavy lifting, too much sitting in front of a computer or poor work conditions can all attribute to joints not moving, self lubricating and repairing properly. Having adjustments re-establish correct movement and allow the body to move with better efficiency.

[Will I receive treatment at the first visit?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/#toggle-4)

Yes! Unless your chiropractor feels the need to refer you for any tests first.

[Will I need x-rays?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/#toggle-5)

Not usually. In most cases a diagnosis can be made without X-Rays. If you do need X-Rays or any other images (e.g. MRI) these can be organised and bulk billed when appropriate.

### Stretches for Long Car Rides to Prevent Back Pain

![man and woman packing car](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/stretches-for-long-car-rides_web.jpg)Long car rides can take a toll on your spine. Being confined to a seated position for hours often leads to stiffness and discomfort. Fortunately, a few simple stretches can make a significant difference.

Before your trip, prepare your body with gentle neck rolls, shoulder circles, and forward bends. During your drive, plan to stop every 1-2 hours for quick stretch breaks.

Try these effective stretches at each stop:

Standing Backbends: Place hands on your lower back and gently lean backward to counteract the forward driving position.

Hamstring Stretch: Place your heel on a bumper or curb and gently lean forward to release tension in your legs and lower back.

Shoulder Rolls: Roll shoulders backward and forward to relieve upper back stiffness.

Stay hydrated during your trip, as dehydration can contribute to muscle fatigue and tension.

These simple proactive measures can help you arrive at your destination feeling comfortable and ready to enjoy your time there!

### Stress Reduction Techniques for Neck and Shoulder Tension

![woman experiencing neck tension](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/stress-reduction-for-neck-and-shoulder-tension_web.jpg)That tight, achy feeling in your neck and shoulders is often a direct response to stress. When we’re mentally tense, our bodies respond physically—particularly in the upper body.

Try progressive muscle relaxation: deliberately tense muscle groups for 5-10 seconds, then slowly release. This helps you recognise the difference between tension and relaxation.

Mindful breathing exercises work wonders too. Take slow, deep breaths while focusing on gradually relaxing your shoulders away from your ears. Even 5 minutes can significantly reduce muscle tension.

Heat therapy, such as a warm shower or heating pad, helps relax tight muscles. Follow with gentle stretches to maintain that relaxation.

Remember that regular chiropractic adjustments play an important role in managing stress-related tension. They address physical manifestations of stress and help your body better adapt to stressors.

Next time tension creeps into your upper body, try these techniques for quick relief!

### The Role of Nutrition in Managing Chronic Pain

![group dinner](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/role-of-nutrition-in-managing-chronic-pain_web.jpg)What you eat can significantly impact how you feel, especially when managing chronic pain. Certain foods can either fight inflammation or fuel it, directly affecting your comfort and mobility.

Build your diet around anti-inflammatory foods: colourful fruits and vegetables, fatty fish rich in omega-3s, nuts, seeds, and olive oil. These contain compounds that naturally help reduce inflammation in the body.

Avoid foods that increase inflammation: processed foods, refined sugars, and excessive red meat. Many people also find that reducing dairy and gluten can decrease pain symptoms.

Staying well-hydrated is equally important, as dehydration can intensify pain perception and slow healing processes.

While nutrition alone may not eliminate chronic pain, it’s a powerful complement to regular chiropractic care. Small dietary changes can lead to noticeable improvements in daily comfort.

Need personalised advice on nutrition for pain management? We’re here to support your wellness journey through comprehensive care.

### Healing on Pause? Your Spine Might Be Sending Mixed Signals

![woman outdoors with hands on lower back](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/healing-on-pause-your-spine-might-be-sending-mixed-signals_web.jpg)Some people bounce back fast from a strain or sore spot. Others stay stuck in a holding pattern. If your recovery feels slower than it used to, the issue may be deeper than muscle tension; it could involve your nervous system.

Your spine protects the network of nerves that carry healing signals throughout your body. But those signals can get scrambled when movement is restricted due to sitting, past injuries, or even stress. Healing still happens, but it may feel slow, incomplete, or inconsistent.

During a chiropractic visit, we assess how your spine moves and look for areas where joint restrictions may interfere with nerve communication. Techniques like hands-on adjustments or gentle instrument-based care can help restore motion so your body can repair more efficiently.

If you’ve been waiting for healing that just isn’t kicking in, this may be a good time to see whether your spine is adding friction to the process.

### Chiropractic Doesn’t Hide Discomfort, It Helps Clear the Path

![woman having neck adjusted](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/chiropractic-doesnt-hide-discomfort-it-helps-clear-the-path_web.jpg)Discomfort is a signal, not a flaw. Whether it’s a tight neck, a dull ache in your lower back, or stiffness that shows up out of nowhere, pain is your body’s way of saying, “Pay attention here.”

Quick fixes, such as anti-inflammatories or pain relief creams, may help in the short term, but they don’t explain why the issue keeps recurring. If symptoms are recurring, there’s often an underlying movement issue that’s interfering with how your body functions.

Chiropractic care examines spinal motion and how it may affect the nervous system’s ability to manage stress, coordinate movement, and support healing. We use a variety of techniques to restore better alignment and reduce built-up tension.

This kind of care doesn’t “treat pain”; it helps clear the interference that may be contributing to it.

If your go-to solutions aren’t providing lasting relief, it might be time to examine what your spine is doing behind the scenes.

### Headaches, Poor Sleep, General Tension? Start with the Spine

![man doing yoga on a mat](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/headaches-poor-sleep-general-tension-start-with-spine_web.jpg)Some days, your body just feels “off.” Maybe you’re sleeping okay, eating pretty well, stretching when you can, but the tension keeps creeping back. What’s happening?

One possibility is that spinal tension interferes with how your nervous system supports the rest of your body. Nerves branch out from your spine, influencing everything from muscle tone to how well you can wind down at night. If alignment is off, even slightly, it can add extra stress behind the scenes.

Common signs include a headache that returns after sitting or screen time, a heavy or tense feeling in the shoulders, and restlessness or shallow sleep.

These aren’t always “fixable” with posture alone. Chiropractic care focuses on improving spinal movement so that nerve signals can travel more freely without adding extra work to your body.

If you’re feeling like your usual strategies aren’t cutting it, a check-in with your spine might offer some helpful clues.

### Your Spine’s Survival Guide for Festive Travel

![mom, dad, and kid in airport smiling at one another](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/your-spines-survival-guide-for-holiday-travel_web.jpg)Long car rides and cramped airplane seats can leave your spine feeling stiff and achy. When you’re stuck in one position for hours, spinal joints lose mobility and surrounding muscles grow fatigued trying to support you. This combination often leads to that uncomfortable “locked up” feeling when you finally stand.

Before you hit the road, try these travel-friendly habits:  
Roll a small towel and place it behind your lower back for lumbar support.  
Stop every 90 minutes to walk and stretch for just 5 minutes.  
Adjust your seat so your knees are slightly lower than your hips.  
Pack a tennis ball to roll along your mid-back while resting.

Safe travels start with a healthy spine. Need a pre-trip tune-up? Give us a call before you head out!

### Festive Activities Without the Aches

![man standing on ladder putting up holiday lights](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/holiday-activities-without-the-aches_web.jpg)This time of year brings plenty of physical activity—decorating, cooking, shopping, and hosting gatherings. While these tasks feel festive, they often involve repetitive movements, awkward positions, and lifting that your spine isn’t used to.

Stay injury-free with these wellness tips:  
**Warm up** with light stretching before tackling big projects.  
**Bend at your knees** (not your back) when lifting boxes or bags.  
**Take frequent breaks** to avoid overworking the same muscle groups.  
**Ask for help** with heavy items instead of trying to manage alone.

The festive season also means schedule changes and less time for your usual exercise routine. When daily movement decreases but physical demands increase, your body feels the mismatch. Pay attention to your posture during activities—whether you’re wrapping gifts on the floor or standing at the kitchen counter for hours.

### How Your Pillow Affects Your Morning

![smiling woman laying in bed with head on pillow](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/how-your-pillow-affects-your-morning_web.jpg)Waking up with neck pain or a stiff back? Your pillow might be working against you. During sleep, your spine needs proper support to maintain its natural curves. The wrong pillow height or firmness can force your neck into awkward positions for 7-8 hours straight, creating tension that carries into your day.

Side sleepers need a thicker pillow to fill the space between the mattress and head, keeping the neck level with the spine. Back sleepers do better with a thinner pillow that doesn’t push the head too far forward. Stomach sleeping (though not ideal) requires the flattest pillow possible—or none at all—to avoid excessive neck rotation.

Your pillow should support the curve of your neck without tilting your head up or down. If you wake up needing to “crack” your neck or feeling unrested, it might be time to reassess your sleep setup. A good pillow paired with proper spinal alignment can dramatically improve sleep quality and how you feel in the morning.

If you’re spending long hours at your desk, chiropractic care can make a world of difference. Schedule a visit today and discover how we can help you feel your best—even during your busiest workdays!

### How to Safely Lift Heavy Objects Without Hurting Your Back

![man and woman moving sofa](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/man-woman-lifting-sofa_web.jpg)

Lifting heavy objects improperly is one of the most common causes of back injuries. Whether you’re moving things around the house or bringing a heavy package indoors, here are some tips to help you lift safely and protect your spine:

**Plan Ahead:** Ensure the path is clear and the object isn’t too heavy for you to manage alone.

**Bend Your Knees:** Squat down and keep your back straight, using your legs—not your back—to lift.

**Hold the Object Close:** Keep it as close to your body as possible to reduce strain.

**Avoid Twisting:** Turn your whole body, not just your torso, to avoid unnecessary pressure on your spine.

If you feel discomfort after lifting, chiropractic care may help alleviate tension and prevent further issues. Our team is here to help you stay pain-free and active. Don’t hesitate to reach out for an appointment!

### Daily Habits to Maintain a Healthy Spine

![older couple walking outside](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/older-couple-walking-outside-blue-jacket_web.jpg)Maintaining a healthy spine is easier than you think! Here are a few simple daily habits to support your back and overall well-being:

**Practice Good Posture:** Keep your shoulders back, chest open, and chin level whether you’re sitting or standing.

**Stay Active:** Regular exercise strengthens your core, which supports your spine. Walking, yoga, or Pilates are great options.

**Lift Properly:** Bend your knees, not your back, and keep objects close to your body when lifting.

**Sleep Smart:** Choose a supportive mattress and sleep on your side or back to reduce strain on your spine.

**Stay Hydrated:** Water keeps your spinal discs healthy and cushions your vertebrae.

Incorporating these habits into your routine can help prevent pain and maintain spinal health. For added support, visit our practice for personalised care and advice. We can’t wait to see you soon!

### Why Your Shoulder Pain Might Actually Be a Neck Problem

![woman holding shoulder in pain](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/why-shoulder-pain-might-be-neck-problem_web.jpg)That nagging shoulder pain that won’t go away? It might not be coming from your shoulder at all. Your neck and shoulder are intimately connected through a complex network of nerves, muscles, and fascia, which means problems in one area often show up as pain in another.  
When vertebrae in your cervical spine become misaligned or compressed, they can irritate nerves that travel down into your shoulder and arm. This creates what we call “referred pain” – discomfort that you feel in one location but actually originates somewhere else.

This is why rubbing your shoulder or applying heat might provide temporary relief, but the pain keeps returning. You’re treating the symptom, not the source. Many patients initially come to Biotune Chiropractic frustrated because months of shoulder treatments haven’t helped.

If your shoulder pain is accompanied by neck stiffness, headaches, or arm tingling, there’s a good chance your neck is the real culprit. The good news? Once we identify and treat the actual source, lasting relief often follows quickly.

### The 30-Second Desk Break That Saves Your Spine

![woman working at desk looking at computer screen](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/30-second-desk-break-that-saves-your-spine_web.jpg)Sitting for hours creates a perfect storm of spinal compression, tight hip flexors, and rounded shoulders. But you don’t need a gym membership or even much space to counteract the damage – just 30 seconds every hour.

Here’s the sequence: First, stand up and place your hands on your lower back and gently arch backward for 5 seconds, reversing the forward slouch. Then, roll your shoulders backward 5 times to open your chest and reset your posture.

Finish by doing 5 gentle neck rotations in each direction to release cervical tension. The entire routine takes 30 seconds and can be done in any office setting without drawing attention.

The magic happens because you’re actively reversing the positions your body has been stuck in. You’re decompressing vertebrae, opening hip flexors, and reminding your nervous system what proper alignment feels like.

Set an hourly reminder on your phone – your spine will thank you.

### The 5-Minute Morning Routine That Preps Your Spine for the Day

![man sitting in bed and stretching arms upward](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/5-minute-morning-routine-that-preps-your-spine_web.jpg)When you wake up in the morning, you might feel refreshed, but your spine doesn’t! After being compressed all night, try this simple 5-minute routine that activates your core muscles and improves spinal mobility before daily activities begin.

Start with gentle knee-to-chest stretches while still in bed – alternate legs for 30 seconds each to wake up your lower back. Next, stand and perform 10 gentle arm circles backward to open your chest and counter forward head posture.

Follow with cat-cow stretches on your hands and knees for one minute, slowly arching and rounding your spine to restore natural movement patterns. Finish with 30 seconds of gentle neck rotations and side bends.

The key is moving slowly and deliberately – you’re not trying to achieve maximum range of motion, just activating sleeping muscles and encouraging spinal fluid circulation. This routine takes less time than checking your phone, but the payoff lasts all day!

### The Surprising Connection Between Oral Health and Chronic Pain

![woman brushing teeth in front of mirror](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/connection-between-oral-health-chronic-pain_web.jpg)Did you know that the health of your mouth might be linked to those persistent aches and pains? A groundbreaking study from the University of Sydney has revealed that poor oral health is significantly associated with higher instances of migraines, abdominal and body pain in women.

The research identified specific oral microbes that correlate with certain pain conditions, suggesting a relationship between the bacteria in our mouths and our nervous system. This connection was particularly strong in people with fibromyalgia.

What does this mean for your health journey? Taking care of your teeth and gums isn’t just about preventing cavities—it could be an important step in managing chronic pain conditions! Women with poor oral health were 60% more likely to experience moderate to severe body pain and 49% more likely to suffer from migraine headaches.

At our practice, we believe in a holistic approach to wellness. While we focus on spinal health, we recognise that true wellness encompasses every aspect of your body. Consider adding regular dental check-ups to your health maintenance routine alongside your chiropractic visits!

![woman with joint pain in her hand](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/weather-and-joint-pain_web.jpg)Ever notice your joints seem to “predict” weather changes? You’re not imagining it! Many people experience increased discomfort when weather patterns shift, especially during changes in barometric pressure, humidity, or temperature.

When barometric pressure drops (often before rain or storms), tissues in your body may expand slightly, potentially putting pressure on joints and pain receptors. For those with existing inflammation, arthritis, or misalignments, these subtle changes can trigger noticeable discomfort.

At our practice, we help patients manage weather-related pain through adjustments that optimise joint function regardless of what’s happening outside. Additionally, we recommend staying active even during uncomfortable weather changes, as movement helps distribute synovial fluid in your joints and reduces stiffness.

Warming therapies like heat packs, warm baths, or gentle stretching may also provide relief during challenging weather periods. Remember, while we can’t control the forecast, we can support your body’s resilience to weather fluctuations through regular chiropractic care.

### Chiropractic Care for Weekend Warriors: Maximizing Performance & Recovery

![man and woman hiking outdoors](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/chiropractic-for-weekend-warriors_web.jpg)Are you someone who squeezes all your physical activity into the weekend? Whether it’s going for a hike, joining a rec league, or tackling intense home improvement projects, “weekend warriors” often experience unique physical challenges.

Weekend-only exercise patterns can put extra stress on your body, leading to soreness, injuries, and decreased performance. Your spine and joints aren’t prepared for sudden bursts of activity after days of relative inactivity, making you more vulnerable to strains and misalignments.

Regular chiropractic care can be a game-changer for weekend warriors! Adjustments throughout the week help maintain proper alignment, ensuring your body is ready when Saturday arrives. This proactive approach improves your range of motion, enhances nervous system function, and helps prevent those dreaded Monday morning aches.

We recommend combining chiropractic visits with simple daily movement practices. Even brief stretching sessions during the workweek can help keep your body primed for weekend adventures.

### Tech Neck to Text Neck: Modern Solutions for Digital Age Posture Problems

![woman looking at phone](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/woman-yellow-shirt-looking-phone_web.jpg)Are you constantly looking down at your phone or tablet? This habit could be taking a toll on your spine.

When your head is properly aligned, your neck muscles manage its weight easily. However, tilting your head forward to check messages dramatically increases the pressure on your neck – imagine the difference between holding a bowling ball close to your body versus holding it at arm’s length. This added strain can lead to headaches, neck pain, and shoulder tension.

To protect your spine in our digital world, try raising your device to eye level when possible, taking regular screen breaks, and practicing gentle neck stretches. A helpful tip is the “chin tuck” exercise: while standing with your back against a wall, gently draw your chin back, creating a double chin. Hold for 5-10 seconds and repeat throughout the day.

Remember, small adjustments to how you use your devices can make a big difference in preventing tech-related neck strain. Visit us to learn more about maintaining proper posture in our digital age.

### Weather Changes and Your Joints: Understanding the Connection

![man with joint pain](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/older-man-joint-pain-outside_web.jpg)Ever notice your joints feeling stiffer on rainy days? You’re not imagining it! Changes in barometric pressure can affect how your joints feel, especially if you have underlying conditions or previous injuries. When atmospheric pressure drops, it may cause tissues around your joints to expand slightly, potentially leading to increased discomfort. While we can’t control the weather, there are ways to manage these effects.

Staying active with gentle indoor exercises, maintaining proper hydration, and keeping warm can help minimise weather-related joint pain. Regular chiropractic care may also help your body adapt to these natural changes more effectively.

Understanding this connection helps explain why some people can “feel” weather changes coming – your body is actually responding to subtle environmental shifts. Don’t let changing weather keep you from staying active and comfortable!

### Core Strength: Your Spine’s Best Friend

![woman exercising with trainer](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/woman-neon-clothes-core-exercise_web.jpg)Think of your core as your body’s natural support belt. These essential muscles work together to stabilise your spine, improve your posture, and prevent back pain. While many people associate core strength with visible abs, it’s about developing the deep muscles supporting your entire trunk.

Simple daily activities like maintaining good posture while sitting, carrying groceries, or picking up your child all rely on core stability. Start building your core with gentle exercises like pelvic tilts or bridges while lying on your back. As you progress, incorporate movements like planks or bird-dogs. Remember to breathe normally during these exercises and never force movements that cause discomfort.

A strong core doesn’t happen overnight, but consistent attention to these supporting muscles can significantly improve your spinal health and overall well-being.

### How Different Exercise Styles Impact Your Spine

![women walking](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/how-different-exercise-styles-impact-your-spine_web.jpg)Exercise is vital for spinal health, but did you know different activities affect your spine in unique ways? Swimming provides gentle decompression through buoyancy, making it ideal for herniated discs. Yoga enhances flexibility and core strength while promoting proper alignment through mindful movement.

Strength training, when done correctly, builds the supportive muscles around your spine, creating a natural brace. However, improper form can strain your back—especially with weighted exercises.

Walking offers accessible, low-impact movement that stimulates spinal disc nutrition through gentle compression and release. Even cycling provides cardiovascular benefits with minimal spinal impact when properly fitted to your body.

The key is variation—your spine benefits from diverse movements rather than repetitive stress. Listen to your body’s feedback and adjust accordingly. Consider consulting with us before starting a new exercise program, especially if you have existing spinal concerns.

### Technology & Spinal Health: Wearable Tech & Apps for Better Posture

![woman working at computer](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/technology-and-spinal-health_web.jpg)Technology can both harm and help your posture. These innovative tools can help you maintain better spinal alignment throughout the day:

Posture sensors like Upright Go 2 attach to your upper back and gently vibrate when you slouch, training you to maintain proper alignment.

Smart clothing such as the AlignMed uses gentle compression to encourage proper shoulder position.

Apps like PostureScreen Mobile analyse photos of your posture, providing assessments and improvement recommendations.

For office workers, Balansit promotes “Dynamic Sitting” to combat sedentary habits, improving posture and diaphragmatic breathing—boosting focus and reducing stress.

Even smartphones can help posture—set alignment reminders or use health apps to track movement.

Remember, technology works best when combined with professional care and consistent awareness of body positioning.

### Sleep Positions & Spinal Health: Finding Your Optimal Rest

![woman sleeping with arms above head](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/sleep-positions-and-spinal-health_web.jpg)The position you sleep in significantly impacts your spinal health. Back sleepers maintain the most neutral alignment, particularly with a pillow that supports the natural curve of the neck. This position distributes weight evenly, reducing pressure points.

Side sleeping ranks second-best, especially with a pillow that keeps your spine horizontal from head to hips. Placing a small pillow between the knees further aligns the pelvis and lower spine.

Stomach sleeping puts considerable strain on your neck and lower back as it forces unnatural rotation. If you’re committed to this position, try placing a thin pillow under your pelvis to reduce lumbar strain.

Your mattress matters too—aim for medium firmness that supports while contouring to your body’s natural curves. Most importantly, notice how you feel in the morning. Waking with stiffness or pain signals a need for adjustment in your sleeping setup.

### Your Spine’s Hidden Role in Stress Relief

![woman sitting on bed with hand on her lower back](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/your-spines-hidden-role-in-stress-relief_web.jpg)Ever feel tense even after a long weekend or a good night’s sleep? Your spine might be part of the puzzle. When vertebrae lose mobility, your body compensates by tightening nearby muscles.

This constant tension keeps your nervous system in “alert” mode—making true relaxation harder to achieve. Gentle chiropractic adjustments can help restore natural movement and reduce that built-up tension. When your spine moves the way it should, your body can switch from fight-or-flight to rest-and-recover mode more easily. You might notice fewer headaches, less shoulder tightness, and a lighter feeling overall.

If you’re feeling stressed or tense, give us a call to book an appointment. We’d love the chance to see you in the practice soon and help you feel a bit more relaxed!

### The Link Between Digestion and Spinal Health

![man eating bowl of food and smiling](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/the-link-between-digestion-spinal-health_web.jpg)Your spine influences much more than your posture—it may also affect how your organs function. Nerves that help control digestion pass through the mid-back region of your spine. When spinal motion becomes restricted, those nerve messages can get disrupted, sometimes contributing to bloating, sluggish digestion, or general abdominal discomfort.

Chiropractic adjustments aim to restore motion and ease interference so your body can function at its best—from head to gut. When nerve communication flows freely, your digestive system can better coordinate processes like enzyme release, muscle contraction, and nutrient absorption.

Combined with mindful eating, proper hydration, and gentle movement, supporting your spinal health can help your digestive system work more efficiently. Listening to your body’s signals, eating slowly, and maintaining regular chiropractic check-ins all work together to keep things moving comfortably. A well-aligned spine truly supports overall wellness—even after mealtime!

### Why Balance Starts with Your Spine

![woman walking in woods balancing on a log](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/why-balance-starts-with-your-spine_web.jpg)Good posture isn’t just about standing tall—it’s about staying steady. Your spine is your body’s central support column, helping distribute weight evenly and keeping you balanced as you move through daily life. Even small spinal misalignments can throw off your equilibrium, affecting coordination and increasing your risk of slips or falls, especially as you age.

Feeling out of balance? Try these simple behaviours:

*   Stand on one foot while brushing your teeth.
*   Take short (slow) walks on uneven ground to challenge your stabilizer muscles.
*   Check your posture at your desk—your ears should line up with your shoulders.

Chiropractic care focuses on maintaining proper spinal alignment, which helps your brain and body communicate effectively. This improved connection supports better body awareness, stability, and confidence in your movements.

Whether you’re walking the dog, gardening, or practicing yoga, balance truly begins with your spine!

### The Hidden Connection Between Jaw Pain and Spinal Health

![woman with glasses having jaw pain](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/the-hidden-connection-between-jaw-pain_web.jpg)Your jaw and spine are more connected than you might realise. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and your cervical spine work together as an integrated system, meaning problems in one area often affect the other.

Poor neck posture – like forward head position from computer work – can strain the muscles that control jaw movement. This creates tension that contributes to jaw clenching, teeth grinding, and TMJ dysfunction. Conversely, jaw misalignment can force compensatory changes in neck positioning, leading to headaches and cervical spine problems.

The trigeminal nerve, which controls jaw muscles, has connections throughout the upper cervical region. When this area becomes irritated, it can trigger both jaw pain and neck tension simultaneously.

Care often requires addressing both areas. Chiropractic adjustments to restore proper cervical alignment may reduce jaw tension, while jaw exercises and stress reduction techniques support overall improvement. A collaborative approach between chiropractic and dental care often yields the best results!

### The Role of Nutrition in Spinal Health and Recovery

![woman drinking from reusable water bottle](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/the-role-of-nutrition-in-spinal-health-recovery_web.jpg)Did you know that what you eat directly impacts your spine’s ability to heal and maintain itself? Your spinal discs, like all tissues, require specific nutrients to function optimally and repair damage from daily wear and stress.

Anti-inflammatory foods form the foundation of spine-healthy nutrition. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish, walnuts, and flaxseeds help reduce inflammation around spinal joints. Colourful vegetables and fruits provide antioxidants that combat oxidative stress contributing to disc degeneration.

Hydration plays a crucial role. Spinal discs are approximately 80% water and rely on adequate fluid intake to maintain their shock-absorbing properties. Even mild dehydration can affect disc height and flexibility.

Key nutrients for spinal health include vitamin D and calcium for bone strength, magnesium for muscle relaxation, and vitamin C for collagen synthesis in ligaments and tendons. Protein provides amino acids necessary for tissue repair after chiropractic adjustments.

Inflammatory foods like processed sugars, trans fats, and excessive refined carbohydrates can perpetuate spinal inflammation and slow healing.

### Chiropractic Care for Athletes: Beyond Injury Treatment

![woman at swimming pool taking off goggles](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/chiropractic-care-for-athletes-beyond-injury-treatment_web.jpg)Athletic performance isn’t just about strength and endurance, it’s about optimal biomechanics and nervous system function. Chiropractic care offers athletes advantages that extend far beyond treating injuries after they occur.

Regular spinal adjustments can improve range of motion, enhance proprioception (body awareness), and optimise nerve communication between the brain and muscles. This leads to better coordination, faster reaction times, and more efficient movement patterns during competition.

Different sports create specific spinal stresses. Golfers may develop rotational restrictions, runners often experience sacroiliac dysfunction, and swimmers may develop thoracic spine stiffness. Understanding these sport-specific patterns allows for targeted preventive care.

Many professional athletes credit regular chiropractic care with extending their careers and maintaining peak performance levels throughout demanding seasons. The key is consistency – making chiropractic care part of your training regimen, not just your injury protocol.

### The Stress-Spine Connection

![woman with glasses having headache pain](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/the-stress-spine-connection_web.jpg)Stress isn’t only in your head—it can show up in your body too. Tight shoulders, jaw clenching, or tension headaches can all be physical signs of emotional strain. Left unchecked, this tension can gradually restrict spinal movement, creating a cycle where the body struggles to relax and heal fully.

Chiropractic care can help by assessing how well the spine moves and whether restricted joints are interfering with nerve communication. When joints move freely, signals between the brain and body flow without interference, making it easier to adapt to daily challenges. Patients often report they feel lighter, calmer, or more able to handle life when their spine isn’t working against them.

Stress won’t vanish overnight, but removing some of the physical tension may give your body the extra bandwidth it needs to recharge. Curious? We’d love to help-reach out to schedule a visit.

### Why Kids Bounce Back Differently Than Adults

![woman having back examined](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/why-kids-bounce-back-differently-than-adults_web.jpg)Children’s spines are flexible and resilient, but they’re not immune to stress. Heavy backpacks, long hours of screen time, or bumps and falls in sports can all influence posture and alignment. Kids may bounce back faster than adults, but small misalignments at an early age can create habits that affect them later.

Adults, on the other hand, often recover more slowly because stress, repetitive work habits, or past injuries accumulate over time. Chiropractic care for both children and adults focuses on helping the spine move properly so the nervous system can function without interference.

Encouraging healthy posture and regular spinal check-ups early in life may help protect long-term health. The habits built during childhood often carry forward, making it easier to stay active, resilient, and balanced as the years go on.

### Weekend Warrior? Protect Your Spine from Overdoing It

![man and woman gardening outdoors](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/protect-your-spine-from-overdoing-it_web.jpg)If you spend weekdays behind a desk and then hit the gym, garden, or sports field hard on weekends, your body may be caught off guard. Muscles that sit dormant all week can tighten, and sudden bursts of activity on an unprepared spine increase the risk of stiffness, soreness, or recurring aches.

Regular chiropractic visits may help keep your spine balanced and mobile, so your nervous system adapts more efficiently. With improved flexibility and movement, your body can handle sudden changes in activity with less resistance. Many “weekend warriors” find recovery feels easier when their spine isn’t working against them.

If you want Mondays to feel less punishing after an active weekend, a little ongoing spinal maintenance could make all the difference. We’re here to help whenever you need it.

### Start Your Fitness Goals Without Starting with Pain

![three people doing situps in a gym](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/start-your-fitness-goals-without-starting-with-pain_web.jpg)January gyms are full of enthusiastic people ready to transform their health—but pushing too hard, too fast often leads to strain and derailed goals. Your body needs time to adapt to new demands, especially if you’ve been less active.

Common mistakes include doing too much volume too soon, skipping warm-ups, ignoring proper form, and pushing through pain instead of recognising warning signals. Your spine plays a central role in nearly every exercise. When spinal joints aren’t moving properly, your body compensates by overworking other areas, increasing injury risk. A pre-workout chiropractic check ensures your foundation is solid before adding new physical stress.

If you’re launching a new routine this year, schedule a visit to make sure your spine is ready to support your goals. We’re here to help you start strong and stay consistent!

### The Fresh-Start Desk Setup

![woman with glasses working at a computer](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/the-fresh-start-desk-setup_web.jpg)If you spend hours at a desk, small ergonomic improvements can dramatically reduce strain on your spine, neck, and shoulders. January is perfect for refreshing your workspace.

Start with these adjustments: position your monitor at arm’s length with the top at or slightly below eye level. Keep your keyboard close so elbows stay near your body at 90 degrees. Adjust your chair so feet rest flat and thighs are parallel to the floor. Use lumbar support to maintain your lower back’s natural curve.

Did you know that for every inch your neck shifts forward and out of proper posture, the strain on your spine doubles? If you use a laptop regularly, add an external keyboard and raise the screen to eye-level.

Remember the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds and shift position. Need personalized advice? We’re happy to discuss your setup!

### Why Wellness Goals Fail (And How Your Spine Can Help Them Stick)

![woman sitting on bed with back pain](https://doc.vortala.com/global/images/why-wellness-goals-fail-and-how-your-spine-can-help-them-stick_web.jpg)Most New Year’s resolutions fade by mid-February—not from lack of willpower, but because the physical foundation isn’t there. When your body feels stiff, achy, or constantly fatigued, even simple goals feel harder than they should.

If standing to prep meals causes back pain, you’ll order takeout. If morning stiffness makes getting up difficult, that early workout won’t happen.

Regular chiropractic care removes these obstacles by improving mobility, reducing tension that drains energy, supporting better sleep, and enhancing body awareness. When your body feels good, consistency becomes easier.

Ready to set yourself up for success? Let’s talk about how chiropractic care fits into your wellness plan this year!

A New Year Reset That Feels Good
================================

New year energy can feel exciting…and a little intense. Suddenly it’s calendar upgrades, big plans, and the urge to overhaul everything overnight. But if your body is already carrying tension from long days, busy schedules, or too much screen time, the best “reset” might be a simpler one.

Instead of chasing a perfect routine, try focusing on a steady body and a calmer baseline. When your body feels supported, it’s easier to follow through on the habits you want to keep.

**Start With the Signals, Not the Pressure**

If you’ve been waking up stiff, feeling tight through the shoulders, or noticing little aches that come and go, your body may be asking for more support—not more willpower. Stress, sitting posture, and repetitive movement patterns can add up quietly. You might not even notice how much you’re compensating until you finally slow down.

A good New Year reset isn’t about pushing harder. It’s about tuning in.

**Small Shifts That Make a Big Difference**

You don’t need a complete lifestyle makeover to feel better. Try a few gentle changes that are easy to repeat:

**Create a “posture checkpoint”:** Pick one daily trigger—making coffee, opening your laptop, brushing your teeth—and use it as a reminder to roll your shoulders back and lengthen your spine.

**Add two minutes of movement:** A short walk, a few stretches, or a quick mobility routine can help your body feel less “stuck.”

**Build a wind-down habit:** Even 5-10 minutes away from screens before bed can help your body settle.

**Where Chiropractic Fits In**

Chiropractic care is often part of a bigger wellness routine—especially for people who want to feel more comfortable in their everyday movement. If your spine and joints aren’t moving as freely as they could, you may feel it in your posture, your energy, and how your body handles busy weeks.

Many people choose chiropractic as part of their reset because it supports how the body moves and adapts over time—without needing a major disruption to their routine.

**Make This Year About Feeling Supported**

If you’re setting goals this year, consider adding a goal that feels less like pressure and more like support: better movement, steadier posture, and a body that feels easier to live in.

Curious where to start? Our team is happy to chat and share practical tips that suit your lifestyle and schedule.

Advanced BioStructural Correction (ABC™)  
in Joondalup and Yanchep
===================================================================

![Dr-Matt-Coxall-and-Patient](https://doc.vortala.com/childsites/uploads/2891/files/Dr-Matt-Coxall-and-Patient.jpg)Advanced BioStructural Correction (ABC™) is a gentle chiropractic approach that supports the body’s natural alignment and structural balance. This hands-on method focuses on identifying areas of the spine and body that may contribute to postural strain or movement compensation. Chiropractors use specific adjustments and guided stretches to encourage improved [posture,](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/poor-posture/)
 alignment, and overall musculoskeletal function.

How ABC™ Works
--------------

Adjustments may involve the spine, pelvis, ribs, and lower limbs, recognising that the entire structure works together to maintain balance and posture.

ABC™ adjustments are often performed while standing, allowing the body to integrate changes naturally.

This method does not rely on instruments or specialised tables and aims to release areas of tension while encouraging a return towards better structural alignment.

What You May Notice
-------------------

Many people receiving ABC™ care describe feeling lighter, standing more upright, or moving more freely after a session. These experiences vary between individuals and depend on factors such as lifestyle, general health, and consistency of care.

Over time, improved spinal alignment and posture may contribute to:

*   Enhanced comfort and mobility
*   A sense of ease when standing or sitting
*   Better postural awareness in daily life

As with all manual therapies, individual experiences and outcomes can vary.

Ongoing Postural Support
------------------------

At [Biotune Chiropractic](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)
, we take a proactive approach to posture and spinal health. Alongside chiropractic adjustments, we provide guidance on daily habits and movement strategies to help you maintain alignment between visits.

Our goal is to support your body’s natural ability to move, adapt, and function comfortably so you can continue doing the things you enjoy.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**Does ABC™ care hurt?**

Most people find this approach gentle and comfortable. You may feel light pressure or stretching as tension releases, but discomfort is uncommon.

**How is ABC™ different?**

ABC™ focuses on structural alignment and posture, using guided adjustments that help restore natural balance throughout the body.

**How many sessions will I need?**

Each person is different. Your chiropractor will discuss a care plan based on your posture, goals, and how your body responds to care.

Celebrating Spinal Health Week 2023
===================================

Published on May 22, 2023

Your spine is an incredible part of your body that plays a critical role in supporting your entire frame and helping you to move freely. With Spinal Health Week upon us, we wanted to take the time to educate you about the importance of your spine so you can keep it in tip-top condition!

Here are some tips to help you keep your spine healthy:

![Spine model](https://doc.vortala.com/childsites/uploads/2891/files/spine-model.jpg)

1.  **Exercise regularly:** Regular exercise is essential for keeping your spine healthy. Try to incorporate activities that help to strengthen your core and back muscles, such as Pilates, or weight training.
2.  **Maintain good posture:** Poor posture can put unnecessary strain on your spine, leading to pain and discomfort. Try to maintain [good posture](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/poor-posture/)
     throughout the day, whether you’re sitting, standing, or walking (ask us how to do it better!)
3.  **Lift objects correctly:** If you need to lift heavy objects, be sure to use the correct lifting technique to avoid putting strain on your back. Bend your knees and keep your back straight while lifting.
4.  **Take frequent breaks:** If you spend long hours sitting at a desk or in front of a computer, be sure to take frequent breaks to stretch and move around. Sitting for prolonged periods can put pressure on your spine and lead to stiffness and discomfort.

Fun Facts About Your Spine
--------------------------

Did you know that your spine contains over 120 muscles, 220 ligaments, and 100 joints? It’s also home to the spinal cord, which is responsible for transmitting messages between your brain and the rest of your body. Without a healthy spine, your body simply wouldn’t be able to function properly!

Your spine is divided into 5 regions: cervical (neck), thoracic (upper back), lumbar (lower back), sacrum (pelvis), and coccyx (tailbone). Each region has a specific role to play in supporting your body and allowing for movement. With so many different parts, you can see why it’s important to visit us for a [spinal checkup](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 every now and then!

Even if you’re not experiencing any pain or discomfort, it’s important to have your spine checked regularly to ensure that it’s in good condition. At our practice, we can also provide you with personalised advice and care options to help you maintain a healthy spine for years to come.

Chiropractic Care and Children in Joondalup & Yanchep
=====================================================

![Adjusting child](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/calm-child-adjustment-h.jpg)Childhood is an important time for growth and physical development. Some families choose to include chiropractic care as part of their child’s overall health and wellbeing plan. [Our chiropractors](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 are trained to assess musculoskeletal function, including posture and movement patterns, in children of all ages.

Our chiropractors provide gentle, age-appropriate care and support for musculoskeletal concerns. Through careful assessment and individualised care plans, we aim to support comfort and function in growing bodies.

With increased use of digital devices at school and home, some children may experience changes in posture or report discomfort such as back or neck tension. In such cases, a chiropractic assessment may help identify any musculoskeletal imbalances and provide appropriate care or advice.

When Might a Child See a Chiropractor?
--------------------------------------

Parents sometimes bring their child to see a chiropractor for a musculoskeletal check-up or when they notice things such as:

*   Postural changes
*   Head tilt and shoulder imbalance
*   Discomfort in the neck, back or legs
*   General musculoskeletal tension

It’s important to note that chiropractic care does not replace medical care. If you have any concerns about your child’s health, we encourage you to consult with your general practitioner or paediatrician.

Supporting Healthy Movement and Posture
---------------------------------------

Our chiropractors are experienced in working with children and provide care based on a thorough history and examination. Where appropriate, gentle mobilisation techniques may be used to support musculoskeletal function, comfort, and mobility.

Chiropractic care is tailored to each individual. While some families may report improvements in movement, comfort or posture after chiropractic visits, outcomes vary from person to person, and not all children require or benefit from chiropractic care.  
[CONTACT US](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/contact-us/)

_**Disclaimer:** Chiropractic care for children focuses on musculoskeletal assessment and management. Claims of benefit should not be interpreted as guarantees of outcome. Chiropractic care is not a substitute for medical advice or treatment. For any health concerns, please consult a registered medical practitioner._

We offer individualised care plans designed to align with your personal health needs and goals. When designing your care plan, we always prioritise your comfort and preferences.

How Chiropractic Works
----------------------

Chiropractic care is based on the relationship between the spine, nervous system, and overall musculoskeletal function. Through skilled manual adjustments and supportive therapies, we aim to restore mobility and reduce areas of restriction or tension.

**Disclaimer:** Chiropractic care is not a cure-all and may not be appropriate for all conditions. We will refer you to another health professional if we believe another approach may better suit your needs.

Advanced BioStructural Correction (ABC™)
----------------------------------------

[ABC™](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/advanced-biostructural-correction/)
 is a manual protocol that focuses on identifying postural imbalances and spinal misalignments that the body may be unable to correct on its own. The goal is to help your body maintain more efficient and balanced posture over time.

Some patients have reported feeling more upright or mobile after a session. However, results can vary, and improvements depend on individual circumstances.

**Note:** Individuals’ responses to care may vary. We assess each case individually to determine whether chiropractic care is suitable.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

[Does it hurt?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/#toggle-1)

Chiropractic adjustments are generally gentle and well-tolerated. Soft tissue work may sometimes involve mild discomfort, depending on your sensitivity and the techniques used. Your comfort is always our priority.

[What’s the difference between chiropractic and physiotherapy?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/#toggle-2)

While patient goals can overlap, chiropractors are trained to assess spinal alignment and joint function, focusing on hands-on adjustments, ergonomic advice, and movement recommendations. Physiotherapists typically focus on exercise rehabilitation. We work collaboratively with other health professionals when needed.

Clinical Pilates & Rehabilitation in Joondalup
==============================================

Supporting Movement Through Individualised Exercise
---------------------------------------------------

![Woman doing pilates on mat](https://doc.vortala.com/childsites/uploads/2891/files/woman-helping-pilates.jpg)Pilates is a well-recognised method of movement training that focuses on control, strength, and mobility. While commonly used for general fitness, certain approaches, such as Clinical Pilates, can also support rehabilitation and functional movement under the guidance of appropriately trained health professionals.

Understanding the Difference:  
Clinical vs Studio Pilates
----------------------------------------------------------

**Studio Pilates** classes are typically held in group settings and focus on general fitness, flexibility, and strength. These sessions often incorporate equipment such as reformers, trapeze tables, and mats and are suitable for a wide range of participants.

**Clinical Pilates**, in contrast, is a more targeted and individualised approach. It is often used by health practitioners, including [chiropractors](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/dr-jill-mokrzycki/)
, as part of a broader management plan for musculoskeletal conditions. This type of Pilates may assist individuals in improving mobility, movement patterns, and strength as part of a personalised rehabilitation or management strategy.

Dr Aneesh Manji (Chiropractor)
==============================

A Passion for Helping People Move Freely
----------------------------------------

![Joondalup Chiropractor Dr Aneesh](https://doc.vortala.com/childsites/uploads/2891/files/dr-aneesh-2.jpg)

> “I believe everyone deserves to live comfortably and move with confidence.”

Helping people move more comfortably and confidently is what Dr Aneesh finds most rewarding about his work. His patient-centred approach focuses on understanding each person’s unique experience, ensuring they feel heard, valued, and supported from their very first visit.

Deciding on the Chiropractic Path
---------------------------------

Dr Aneesh has long been fascinated by how the human body functions. His curiosity grew through involvement in various sports and observing how people managed movement and physical discomfort. Knowing early on he wanted to work in healthcare, he discovered chiropractic care in Year 12, a decision that has guided his career ever since.

He is passionate about providing evidence-informed [chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 to support each individual’s movement, comfort, and overall wellbeing, ensuring they can move with greater confidence in their everyday life.

Education and Professional Development
--------------------------------------

Dr Aneesh graduated from Murdoch University with a double degree in Chiropractic Science, gaining a strong foundation in both theory and practical skills. Some of his most rewarding experiences came from volunteering regionally in Geraldton, where he cared for local residents while refining his hands-on abilities.

He is certified in [dry needling](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/dry-needling/)
 and is a qualified [Advanced BioStructural Correction (ABC™)](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/advanced-biostructural-correction/)
 practitioner, expanding his ability to support patients through multiple techniques that focus on function, balance, and overall wellbeing.

Attentive, Understanding, and Focused on You
--------------------------------------------

Patients often notice straight away that Dr Aneesh is attentive and genuinely interested in what’s affecting their quality of life. His calm, professional manner helps them feel comfortable discussing their health goals while building lasting trust.

> “Helping people enjoy life without worrying about pain or holding back from the things they love, that’s what keeps me passionate about what I do.”

Life Beyond the Clinic
----------------------

Outside the practice, Dr Aneesh enjoys an active and balanced lifestyle. He can often be found jogging through his local park, hiking, strength training, or practising calisthenics. In his downtime, he enjoys playing chess, tending to his garden, and catching up with friends over a relaxed drink.

Originally from London, Dr Aneesh moved to Perth with his family in 2009 and deeply values the close-knit relationships and sense of community that continue to shape his outlook on life.

Dr Jill Mokrzycki (Chiropractor)
================================

![Joondalup Chiropractor Dr Jill Mokrzycki](https://doc.vortala.com/childsites/uploads/2891/files/jill-mokrzycki2.jpg)

Having grown up in a health-conscious family that valued natural care and active living, Dr Jill developed an early appreciation for the body’s ability to adapt and recover through movement and mindful habits.

> “If I’m in pain I’ll opt for movement, physical therapy and natural ways of reducing inflammation rather than going straight to pharmaceuticals first.”

Dr Jill takes a thoughtful and collaborative approach to [chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
, helping people navigate pain and movement challenges through evidence-based methods. She values the opportunity to support patients in finding relief without reliance on pharmaceuticals or invasive procedures, and enjoys educating them on the benefits of movement and healthy living.

Guided by Knowledge and Experience
----------------------------------

After graduating from Murdoch University, Dr Jill was deeply influenced by her mentor, Dr Brian Nook, whose teaching shaped how she views assessment and care today. Her professional focus has evolved to include a strong emphasis on sports-based chiropractic, soft tissue techniques, and rehabilitation. She is also exploring a deeper interest in women’s health and [pregnancy care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/pregnancy-chiropractic/)
, combining her hands-on skills with an understanding of each stage of life.

An Approach Built on Listening and Understanding
------------------------------------------------

Warm and genuine in her manner, Dr Jill is known for taking the time to listen. Some sessions focus on breathwork or stress management rather than manual therapy, reflecting her understanding that wellbeing extends beyond the physical.

Her aim is to create a calm, supportive environment where patients feel seen, heard, and understood.

> “I want patients to know that my door is always open. I’m here to help in any way possible within my scope of practice and knowledge.”

A Passion for Movement and Lifelong Learning
--------------------------------------------

Beyond her chiropractic qualifications, Dr Jill is a certified [Clinical Pilates](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/clinical-pilates/)
 instructor and is fully trained in [dry needling](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/dry-needling/)
. She believes movement is central to living well and staying active throughout life. Her love of movement extends beyond the clinic, whether she’s walking her three dogs, hiking outdoors, training at the gym, or diving into the ocean for a cold dip.

When she’s not active, she enjoys baking sourdough bread, reading, and listening to health and wellness podcasts on her commute.

_You can connect with Dr Jill on Instagram at [@jillmok\_chiro](https://www.instagram.com/jillmok_chiro/?hl=en)
, where she shares general movement insights, lifestyle reflections, and professional updates._

Dr Matt Coxall (Principal Chiropractor)
=======================================

![Joondalup Chiropractor Dr Matt](https://doc.vortala.com/childsites/uploads/2891/files/matt-coxall.jpg)

A Decade of Dedicated Chiropractic Care
---------------------------------------

Dr Matt graduated from Murdoch University in Perth in 2014 with a double bachelor’s degree in chiropractic science. With more than ten years in practice, he has had the privilege of supporting people from many walks of life in better understanding their health and how [chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 may assist in maintaining musculoskeletal and nervous system function.

> “My approach is grounded in both experience and care, helping patients feel confident and informed every step of the way.”

Guiding Patients Toward Informed Health Decisions

What Dr Matt enjoys most about being a chiropractor is the chance to educate people on how to achieve their own health goals. He believes that understanding how the body works is key to making sound, informed choices. During consultations, he takes the time to explain his findings, discuss available options, and work collaboratively with each patient to create a care plan that aligns with their goals.

Caring for Individuals and Families
-----------------------------------

> “Chiropractic care has always been part of my life. My family and I have benefited from it since I was young, which inspired me to pursue the profession.”

Over the years, Dr Matt’s practice has grown to include people of all ages, from infants to older adults. He holds postgraduate qualifications in [paediatric care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/paediatric-chiropractic/)
, is certified in [ECC™ (Endonasal Cranial Correction)](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/endonasal-cranial-correction/)
 and is an Advanced Level III certified [ABC™ (Advanced BioStructural Correction)](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/advanced-biostructural-correction/)
 practitioner, using techniques aimed at supporting posture and promoting comfortable functional movement.

Life Outside the Practice

When he’s not at work, Dr Matt enjoys spending time with his wife and two kids, playing a round of golf, or watching sport. He has also been involved in various chiropractic boards and committees over the past decade, contributing to ongoing professional development within the field. He finds that staying active in both family life and professional circles helps keep him balanced.

Dry Needling in Joondalup & Yanchep: What You Should Know
=========================================================

Published on November 3, 2025

![dry needling](https://doc.vortala.com/childsites/uploads/2891/files/back-acupuncture-sq-400-300x300.jpg)Many people are curious about [dry needling](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/dry-needling/)
 and how it might fit into musculoskeletal care when managing muscle tension or localised discomfort. So, what exactly is dry needling? This technique involves the use of fine, sterile needles placed into specific muscles and trigger points.

Dry needling is commonly used in musculoskeletal care to assist with reducing muscular tightness and encouraging improved mobility. Some people seek dry needling when they experience discomfort after activities such as hiking through Yanchep National Park or working out at HBF Arena in Joondalup.

What to Expect During and After a Session
-----------------------------------------

[Your practitioner](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 will assess the areas of concern and determine where dry needling may be applied. The insertion of the needle can create a local twitch response, which some individuals describe as a brief cramp-like sensation. After your session, it is generally recommended to rest for a few hours. High-intensity exercise, such as weight training or long runs along the Yellagonga Regional Park trails, may not be advised immediately afterwards.

Considerations and Suitability
------------------------------

Dry needling may not be appropriate for everyone. For example, it is often not recommended for those with certain blood conditions, people with a strong fear of needles, or young children who may find it difficult to remain still. Your practitioner will review your medical history and discuss any concerns before proceeding.

Potential Effects and Risks
---------------------------

Most individuals report mild, short-term effects such as soreness, bruising, or tenderness at the needle site. Serious complications are rare but will be explained to you prior to care. Responses vary, and outcomes depend on several factors including the nature of your condition and your body’s individual response.

Explore Whether Dry Needling Is Right for You
---------------------------------------------

Dry needling is one of several options that may be considered as part of a broader approach to musculoskeletal care. If you’re interested in learning whether this technique may be suitable for your needs, we invite you to book a consultation. [Our Biotune Chiropractic team](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/)
 will discuss your goals, review your history, and help determine the most appropriate plan moving forward.

Dry Needling : What to Expect  
in Joondalup & Yanchep
======================================================

![applying acupuncture needle](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/applying-acupuncture-needle.jpg)

Dry needling is a technique that targets specific muscles and trigger points. It involves inserting a fine needle into affected areas of soft tissue, which may assist in reducing muscular tightness and discomfort.

After the treatment, [your practitioner](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 will assess the area for changes in muscle tone and mobility. It’s generally advised to rest for a few hours after your session. Strenuous physical activity, including gym workouts, may not be recommended immediately following treatment.

Potential Effects and Considerations
------------------------------------

Dry needling is one of several techniques used to manage musculoskeletal issues. Some individuals report temporary improvements in symptoms such as muscular tightness or localised discomfort. However, outcomes can vary and are dependent on several factors, including the nature of the condition and individual response.

![Needles on back](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/acupuncture-needles-in-back-wide.jpg)

Suitability and Safety
----------------------

Dry needling may not be appropriate for everyone. It is typically not recommended for:

*   Individuals with certain blood disorders
*   People with a history of fainting
*   Those with a significant fear of needles
*   Young children, due to difficulty staying still for the procedure

Your practitioner will assess your individual circumstances to determine whether dry needling is suitable for you.

Risks and Side Effects
----------------------

As with any procedure involving needles, there are potential risks. These may include:

*   Bruising
*   Temporary soreness or tenderness
*   In rare cases, more serious complications (which your practitioner will discuss with you)

Any concerns or medical history will be reviewed prior to treatment to help ensure safety.

Is It Right for You?
--------------------

Dry needling may be one option to consider as part of a broader musculoskeletal care plan. Its effectiveness varies between individuals. A comprehensive assessment is required to determine whether this technique is appropriate for your specific needs.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

[How does dry needling differ from traditional acupuncture?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/dry-needling/#toggle-1)

While both use similar tools, dry needling and acupuncture are based on different principles. Acupuncture is rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, focusing on restoring the body’s energy balance. Dry needling, as used in a chiropractic or musculoskeletal context, involves inserting fine needles into myofascial trigger points to assist in reducing muscle tension and improving function.

[What can I expect after a session?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/dry-needling/#toggle-2)

Some individuals may experience mild soreness, tenderness or bruising at the needle sites, which typically resolves within a few days. Most people are able to continue with their daily activities following a session.

[Are there any reasons dry needling may not be suitable?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/dry-needling/#toggle-3)

Dry needling may not be recommended for individuals with certain medical conditions such as bleeding disorders, active infections, or open wounds. Additional care is taken for individuals with allergies, delayed wound healing, or concerns related to needles. A full health history and assessment will be conducted to determine if this technique is appropriate for you.

[How soon might I notice changes?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/dry-needling/#toggle-4)

Responses to treatment vary. Some people report feeling a change soon after their session, while for others it may take a few treatments to notice an effect. Your chiropractor will monitor your progress and adjust your care plan accordingly.

Endonasal Cranial Correction (ECC™) in Yanchep
==============================================

![](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/2013/11/headache-glasses.jpg)Endonasal Cranial Correction (ECC™) is a gentle manual technique that supports the natural alignment and movement of the cranial bones and surrounding structures of the head and neck.

Whole-Body Connection
---------------------

Unlike approaches that focus solely on the spine, ECC™ recognises the important relationship between the cranial system, posture, and overall structural balance.

At our practice, [Dr Matt (Principal Chiropractor](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/dr-matt-coxall/)
) takes a whole-body approach to care. When bones in the body, particularly within the skull, shift in ways the body cannot self-correct, it may influence comfort, posture, and function in other areas.

Some people choose to explore ECC™ to support concerns such as tension headaches, sinus pressure, jaw discomfort, or postural imbalance.

What to Expect During ECC™
--------------------------

During an ECC™ session, a small, soft balloon is gently inserted into the nasal passage and briefly inflated to encourage improved cranial movement.

This technique is performed as part of the [Advanced BioStructural Correction (ABC™)](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/advanced-biostructural-correction/)
 approach to care.

Areas ECC™ May Support
----------------------

![](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/closeup-young-woman-tooth-ache.jpg)ECC™ is used as an adjunct to chiropractic care and may assist with:

*   Nasal or sinus congestion
*   Facial tension or asymmetry
*   [Head or neck tension](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/neck-pain/)
    
*   Jaw discomfort
*   [Postural imbalance](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/poor-posture/)
     and spinal alignment
*   A sense of restricted breathing through the nose

As with all manual therapies, individual experiences and outcomes can vary.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**Does ECC™ hurt?**

Most people find ECC™ comfortable. You may feel brief pressure in the nasal area during the procedure, but it usually subsides quickly.

**How long does an ECC™ session take?**

A session typically lasts only a few minutes and is performed as part of a broader chiropractic visit.

**Is ECC™ suitable for everyone?**

Your chiropractor will assess your health history and comfort level before recommending ECC™ to ensure it is appropriate for you.

Care for Headaches and Migraines in Joondalup & Yanchep
=======================================================

[Our practice](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)
 offers patient-centred care that focuses on understanding your individual health concerns, including headaches and migraines. Living with recurring headaches can be challenging, and we’re here to support you in exploring non-pharmaceutical options that may help you manage your symptoms.

![Woman holding hands to temples](https://doc.vortala.com/childsites/uploads/2891/files/woman-holding-hands-to-head-400.jpg)Understanding Headaches
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Headaches are among the most commonly reported types of discomfort.

There are various forms, including:

*   Tension headaches, often related to stress or muscle tension
*   Cervicogenic headaches, which may be linked to structures in the neck
*   Migraines, a more complex type of headache that can involve sensitivity to light, sound, and movement

Identifying potential contributing factors, such as posture, screen time, or stress, is an important step in managing headache symptoms.

Contributing Lifestyle Factors
------------------------------

Prolonged periods at a desk, poor posture, and high levels of stress may contribute to discomfort in the neck and shoulders, which some individuals associate with headaches. Adjusting certain lifestyle factors, such as workstation setup and sleep habits, may assist in managing these symptoms.

How Chiropractic Care Could Help
--------------------------------

[Chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 may help some people manage headache-related symptoms. Through manual techniques aimed at improving joint function and reducing muscular tension, some patients may report relief from certain types of headaches, particularly those related to neck tension or posture.

Each person responds differently, and outcomes can vary. Chiropractic care is not a cure for headaches or migraines, but it may be part of a broader approach to managing symptoms for some individuals.

What to Expect
--------------

Your [first visit](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/)
 will include a thorough consultation and physical examination to better understand your health history and current concerns. If chiropractic care is appropriate for your situation, your chiropractor will explain the recommended approach and may perform an adjustment tailored to your needs.

We also provide guidance on posture, ergonomics, and other lifestyle factors that may support your overall wellbeing.

Important Information
---------------------

As with any healthcare treatment, chiropractic care carries potential risks. [Your chiropractor](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 will explain these to you and ensure any care provided is appropriate for your needs and preferences. Individual outcomes vary, and we encourage you to ask questions and make informed decisions about your care.

How Chiropractic Care Can Help With Your Shoulder Pain From Swimming
====================================================================

Published on February 15, 2022

![person swimming in a pool](https://doc.vortala.com/childsites/uploads/2891/files/person-swimming.jpg)Swimming is a great sport for everyone. Whether you are still young or even up to your 80s and beyond, you can benefit from swimming. No matter someone’s background or level of experience at swimming, they can still benefit from it.

Many health benefits come with swimming, as stated in an article by Better Health Channel, such as a normal heart rate, building endurance, improving muscle strength, and maintaining cardiovascular fitness.

Since this sport engages our whole body to navigate the water, we can easily provide a full-body workout since you’ve been using head-to-toe for swimming. Indeed, swimming has a good impact on both our physical and mental health.

On the contrary, our bodies can also get worn out by excessive swimming and repetitive motion, which can cause pain. Since swimming mainly requires the shoulders to get through the water, they are more prone to pain than other joints and muscles used for the said sport.

Almost every swimmer has experienced pain in their shoulders more than once in their lives, and good treatment options for relieving discomfort have been offered to help others recover from the pain they got from swimming.

One of the most effective treatment options for shoulder pain is chiropractic care. [Chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 is performed using spinal manipulations to relieve pain in someone’s joints and muscles. These adjustments will increase blood flow and nerve conductivity to the affected areas where the pain is present.

More so, it can also be used in other body conditions which can cause pain such as neck pain, back pain, headaches and migraines, knee pain, and even hip pain.

Understanding Shoulder Pain with the Help of Chiropractic Care
--------------------------------------------------------------

Our shoulders are used as flippers when we swim through the water, and it is evident that it’s one of the most used parts of the body when it comes to swimming; that is why shoulder pain is a common condition among many swimmers.

Here, we will dive deeper into shoulder pain and how chiropractic care could help.

The most common condition that causes shoulder pain is a swimmer’s shoulder which affects almost 80% of swimmers, according to statistics provided by Science Daily on youth swimmers. Swimmer’s shoulder occurs due to overuse and repetitive motion within the shoulders, which can cause the tendons to get inflamed and press on nearby bones, muscles, and even other tendons.

Sometimes, swimmers with a swimmer’s shoulder wouldn’t notice the symptoms at first, but it would gradually develop and become worse the longer they swim and stay in the water. Swimmers with this kind of shoulder pain can have a reduced range of motion and increased joint laxity compared to the other shoulder that isn’t damaged at all. If not brought to attention, a swimmer’s shoulder can limit the range of motion in the shoulders.

Another Type of Shoulder Pain
-----------------------------

![person holding their shoulder in pain](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/young-adult-holding-shoulder-in-pain-sq-400.jpg)The other type of shoulder pain is shoulder bursitis, which happens when the bursa, a fluid-filled sac that protects the tendons and reduces friction within the shoulder, becomes inflamed. This type of shoulder pain is also caused by overuse and may trigger pain, discomfort, weakness, and stiffness in the shoulder.

Pain from shoulder bursitis can be felt suddenly, and stiffness is one of the most common symptoms of this condition. People suffering from shoulder bursitis can also report pain going worse during nighttime, as their shoulders get pressed when they lay down their mattresses.

According to chiropracticcare.today, these shoulder conditions that cause shoulder pain are treatable and manageable by chiropractic care. One way to relieve discomfort from these conditions is by chiropractic adjustments, which use the hands of your chiropractor to apply a sudden yet controlled force on an affected joint. In this way, the body’s range of motion will increase, improve physical function, and address joint fixations.

Another way to treat shoulder pain with chiropractic care is through therapeutic exercises, which your chiropractor has specially designed for your type of shoulder pain. Since shoulder pain can cause muscle spasms within the shoulder, soft tissue therapy is also performed.

Before conducting any exercises or chiropractic adjustments, you may have to receive a comprehensive physical examination first, so chiropractors know your history and accurately diagnose your condition. Then, they’ll give you adjustments to the problem area by doing exercises and treating them based on the severity of your pain.

After your chiropractic sessions, you’ll receive suggestions from your chiropractor about modifying your swimming training plan to help reduce the risk of a shoulder injury and speed up recovery.

Swimming does wonders for our body, but sometimes, overusing our bodies for swimming can cause us pain. Even if you are just a beginner attending swimming lessons or a competitive swimmer with years of experience; we cannot impossibly avoid pain completely. However, with the help of chiropractic care, we can help recover from the pain and continue with swimming.

Our team at [Biotune Chiropractic](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)

How Dry Needling Can Relieve Pain and Improve Muscle Function Naturally
=======================================================================

Published on June 12, 2025

![dry needling back](https://doc.vortala.com/childsites/uploads/2891/files/acupuncture-hands-sq-400.jpg)Muscle pain can take a toll on your day, whether it’s post-workout soreness, office-chair stiffness, or tension that just won’t budge. [Dry needling offers a natural, hands-on approach that focuses directly on trigger points in the muscles](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/dry-needling/)
. It is a drug-free way to reduce pain and improve mobility without relying on medication.

This modern, evidence-informed technique is becoming a trusted tool among chiropractors and other healthcare providers across Joondalup. It supports the body’s own healing response without the need for medications.

What Makes Dry Needling Different?
----------------------------------

Dry needling involves inserting fine, sterile needles into tight or knotted muscles (called trigger points) to release tension and restore normal muscle function. While it may look similar to acupuncture, the techniques are completely different. Dry needling targets muscle tissue, not energy flow.

How It Works Inside the Muscle
------------------------------

The moment the needle reaches a trigger point, you might feel a twitch – this is just the muscle reacting to the release. The result? Better blood flow, less muscle tension, and nerve stimulation that supports healing from the inside out.

Who Might Benefit?
------------------

Dry needling may help with conditions like:

*   Neck tension and headaches
*   Lower back strain and sciatica
*   Shoulder pain and impingement
*   Elbow pain (tennis/golfer’s elbow)
*   Heel and foot pain, like plantar fasciitis

It’s a practical option for active individuals, desk workers, or anyone managing chronic discomfort.

What You’ll Feel in a Session
-----------------------------

We’ll start with a chat and a gentle assessment. During the session, you might feel a quick prick or a twitch sensation as the needle finds the right spot. The needles are sterile and single-use. They stay in for a few minutes and are then removed to check the muscle’s response.

Our team is trained in anatomy and precise technique. We take the time to assess your needs before starting any care. Sessions are brief, and we tailor the number of visits to your needs. A bit of post-session soreness is normal; you may want to skip the gym that day and allow your body to recover.

Why Patients Choose Biotune Chiropractic for Their Care

. Whether you’re a weekend warrior, desk-bound office worker, or dealing with long-term discomfort, we’ll tailor our care to your goals and support your health with hands-on, thoughtful care.

How Will You Invest in Your Spine this World Spine Day?
=======================================================

Published on October 15, 2025

![world spine day](https://doc.vortala.com/childsites/uploads/2891/files/General-Wellness20-240x300.jpg)On 16 October, [Biotune Chiropractic](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 will join millions of people worldwide in recognising **World Spine Day 2025**. This annual public health initiative highlights the importance of spinal wellbeing and the impact that spinal issues have on communities worldwide.

Why World Spine Day Matters
---------------------------

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), more than 600 million people are affected by low back pain, with numbers continuing to rise. World Spine Day brings much-needed attention to this challenge, while encouraging individuals to take an active role in caring for their spine. The campaign also supports advocacy for improved access to spinal healthcare resources where they are needed most.

The Theme: Invest in Your Spine
-------------------------------

The 2025 theme, _Invest in Your Spine_, reminds us that spinal health is a lifelong priority. Investment can be as simple as making small daily choices that support your body or planning occasional check-ins with a [qualified health professional](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
. Each action contributes to building mobility, strength, and long-term resilience in daily life.

Everyday Habits that Support Spinal Health
------------------------------------------

There are many simple steps you can take to support a healthier spine, including:

*   Staying active with at least 30 minutes of daily movement
*   Using ergonomic seating and maintaining good posture
*   Taking time to stretch throughout the day
*   Limiting long periods on mobile devices
*   Eating a balanced diet and keeping hydrated
*   Aiming for seven to eight hours of quality sleep
*   Taking regular breaks from sitting or repetitive activities

These practices, when built into your daily routine, may help support spinal health and contribute to overall wellbeing over time.

Join Us This World Spine Day
----------------------------

This World Spine Day, Biotune Chiropractic encourages individuals and families to take small, positive steps that support their spinal health. For more information or to schedule an appointment, please contact our team today!

Jaw Pain Care in Joondalup and Yanchep
======================================

At [Biotune Chiropractic](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)
, we provide professional care for individuals experiencing jaw discomfort, using a whole-body approach that considers factors such as neck posture, upper back alignment, and muscle tension. Our focus is on supporting musculoskeletal function and promoting comfort around the jaw and surrounding areas.

What Is the Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ)?
------------------------------------------

The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) connects the lower jaw (mandible) to the skull (temporal bone). Cushioned by small discs, this joint allows a wide range of motion for actions such as opening and closing the mouth, chewing, and speaking.

Common Causes and Symptoms of Jaw Pain
--------------------------------------

![](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/severe-mouth-pain-sq-300.jpg)Jaw discomfort can arise from a variety of factors, including:

*   muscle tension
*   teeth grinding or clenching (bruxism)
*   stress
*   [posture-related strain](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/poor-posture/)
    
*   fall or direct impact to the jaw or face
*   sports injury
*   extended mouth opening during dental procedures
*   side effects of certain diets or medications.

Symptoms can include pain around the jaw joint or temple, neck discomfort, headaches, dizziness, ear fullness, or clicking and popping sounds when opening or closing the mouth.

Jaw Pain Assessment and Diagnosis
---------------------------------

Before recommending any care, [our chiropractors](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 perform a thorough assessment of your jaw and related structures.

This may include discussing your symptoms and their duration, reviewing previous care, and evaluating lifestyle factors such as stress, sleep, diet, and posture. Jaw movement, muscle tension, and joint function are also assessed, along with how neck function and spinal alignment may influence the jaw.

This comprehensive assessment helps us understand the range of factors contributing to your discomfort.

Our Approach to Jaw Pain Care
-----------------------------

Our approach combines manual therapies, exercises, and whole-body guidance to support jaw comfort and function.

Care options may include:

*   Manual techniques to support jaw and neck movement
*   [Soft tissue therapy](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/soft-tissue-therapy/)
     such as massage, myofascial release, or [dry needling](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/dry-needling/)
     to address muscle tension
*   Exercise guidance to improve jaw posture, range of motion, and coordination
*   Lifestyle advice on stress, posture, and, if appropriate, consultation with dental professionals for bite assessment or splints

What to Expect During a Visit
-----------------------------

Your [first visit](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/)
 includes an assessment of jaw and cervical spine function, followed by gentle manual and soft tissue techniques to support movement and comfort. You may also receive home exercises and advice to help manage discomfort and encourage long-term jaw health.

Jaw Tension and Wellness: What Teeth Clenching Might Be Telling You
===================================================================

Waking up with a tight jaw or sore temples? Noticing yourself clenching your teeth during the day? Jaw tension is more common than many people realise – and it may be your body’s way of trying to tell you something: You’re stressed!

**The Link Between Stress and the Jaw**

The jaw is one of the areas in the body where stress often shows up. Clenching or grinding, especially at night, can put extra pressure on the muscles around the face, neck, and shoulders. Some people feel the effects as headaches or general discomfort in the upper back. If you’ve ever found yourself gritting your teeth while concentrating or driving, you’re not alone.

**Posture Plays a Part**

Poor posture, particularly when sitting at a desk or looking down at a phone, can contribute to jaw tension by altering the alignment of the head and neck. A forward head position may increase pressure on the muscles supporting your jaw. Becoming more aware of how you sit or stand throughout the day can help relieve some of that load. Even small shifts, like adjusting your monitor height or taking movement breaks, can make a difference.

**Gentle Habits That May Help**

If you’re noticing tension, simple steps like jaw relaxation exercises, breathing techniques, or using a warm compress at night may provide relief. Reducing screen time before bed and checking in with your posture during the day can also help manage strain.

Wondering if your lifestyle might be contributing to jaw tension? Our team is happy to chat – we’re here with practical, posture-friendly tips to support your everyday comfort.

Knee Pain Support in Joondalup & Yanchep
========================================

Every day at [Biotune Chiropractic](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)
, we see individuals with a range of musculoskeletal concerns, including knee pain. [Our chiropractors](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 are trained in various manual techniques and remain informed on current developments in musculoskeletal healthcare.

Although [chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 is commonly associated with back and neck issues, it may also assist with managing certain types of musculoskeletal knee discomfort. If your symptoms relate to joint or movement dysfunction, chiropractic care may form part of a broader approach to managing your condition.

![Man with knee pain](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/running-knee-pain-sq-400.jpg)Understanding Knee Discomfort
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Knee discomfort can arise from various causes, including sporting incidents, age-related changes, or increased load on the lower limbs. Sometimes, discomfort in the knee may also be linked to movement patterns or tension in other parts of the body.

When to Seek Support
--------------------

If you’re unsure whether your knee symptoms warrant further assessment, some signs that might indicate a need for professional evaluation include:

*   Discomfort when rotating or bending the knee
*   Stiffness, especially in the morning or cold weather
*   Pain at the front or inside of the knee joint
*   Difficulty with certain activities, such as walking or running for extended periods

Footwear and repetitive strain may also contribute to symptoms. A musculoskeletal assessment can help determine potential contributing factors.

How Chiropractic Care May Be Involved
-------------------------------------

Chiropractors focus on the assessment and management of the musculoskeletal system. Where appropriate, this may include gentle manual techniques aimed at improving joint function and addressing muscle tension.

If areas of restricted movement or altered biomechanics are identified, chiropractic care may help to manage symptoms and support overall function. We also offer advice on posture, movement strategies, and ergonomics to complement hands-on care.

Please note that chiropractic treatment is not a cure for knee pain, and outcomes vary depending on the individual. Where necessary, we may refer you to another healthcare provider for further investigation or co-management.

Your First Visit
----------------

Your [initial consultation](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/)
 includes a detailed health history and musculoskeletal assessment. If chiropractic care is considered suitable for your condition, we will discuss a management plan tailored to your needs.

This may involve manual therapy, exercises, or lifestyle advice, depending on your situation. We take a whole-body approach, considering how other areas may impact knee function.

Book an Appointment
-------------------

We offer flexible appointment times to fit your schedule. Contact us today to arrange a consultation and musculoskeletal assessment.

_**Disclaimer:** Chiropractic care focuses on musculoskeletal health. Any treatment or advice provided is based on your individual presentation and may vary from person to person. Chiropractic care is not a replacement for medical treatment. If your condition falls outside our scope, we will refer you to an appropriate healthcare provider._

Lower Back Pain Care in Joondalup & Yanchep
===========================================

At [Biotune Chiropractic](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)
, we offer [chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 that aims to support individuals experiencing musculoskeletal issues, including lower back discomfort. [Our team of chiropractors](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 is dedicated to assessing your individual needs and providing care that may assist in the management of your symptoms.

![Woman sitting on bed with hands on lower back](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/woman-on-bed-with-back-pain-sq-400.jpg)Understanding Lower Back Pain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lower back pain is one of the most commonly reported health concerns in Australia. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, around 70-90% of people will experience lower back pain at some point in their lives. The Australian Bureau of Statistics also estimates that approximately 16% of Australians live with back-related issues.

Lower back pain can be influenced by various factors, such as injury, posture, or repetitive movements. Some people may experience localised tenderness, while others might notice discomfort that radiates into the hips or legs. In some cases, episodes of lower back pain may resolve on their own, but for others, professional care may help manage ongoing or recurring symptoms.

Common Triggers
---------------

Certain activities and positions may aggravate lower back discomfort. These may include:

*   Sitting or standing for long periods
*   Sudden movements or lifting
*   Prolonged time in one posture, such as driving or working at a desk
*   Pre-existing conditions, such as disc-related issues, which may contribute to pain or stiffness

Every individual’s experience is different, and a thorough assessment is essential to determine contributing factors.

How Chiropractic Care May Help
------------------------------

[Chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 involves manual techniques, such as spinal adjustments or mobilisations, which aim to improve joint mobility and support musculoskeletal function. Some individuals with lower back pain report relief or improved movement following chiropractic care.

We begin with a comprehensive evaluation, including a detailed history and physical examination. This process helps us determine whether chiropractic care may be appropriate for your specific situation.

If we believe you may benefit from chiropractic care, we’ll develop a tailored plan that aligns with your needs. If chiropractic care is not suitable, we’ll refer you to another healthcare professional.

Your Individual Care Plan
-------------------------

Your chiropractor may provide recommendations to support your recovery, which could include:

*   Postural advice
*   Modifications to your workstation or sleeping positions
*   Movement and stretching suggestions tailored to your lifestyle

These recommendations are designed to support your overall wellbeing and assist in managing symptoms.

Convenient Appointment Times
----------------------------

We understand that our patients lead busy lives. That’s why we offer early and late appointments to help you access care at a time that works for you. Contact our [practice](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)
 today to request an appointment.

Move Better, Work Better: Workspace Week 20-26 October 2025
===========================================================

Published on October 20, 2025

**![workspace week](https://doc.vortala.com/childsites/uploads/2891/files/workspace-week-sq-300x300.jpg)Workspace Week (20-26 October)** is a national initiative led by the Australian Chiropractors Association. It aligns with Safe Work Australia’s Australian Work Health and Safety (WHS) Strategy 2023-2033, which focuses on creating safe and healthy workspaces for all Australians. This year, the spotlight is on taking simple, practical steps that can reduce strain, boost energy, and help you stay focused during the day.

Why Your Workspace Matters
--------------------------

Musculoskeletal conditions are the #1 work health and safety issue affecting Australian workers, with [neck](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/neck-pain/)
 and [back pain](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/lower-back-pain-and-sciatica/)
 among the most common concerns. Around 7.3 million Australians (29%) live with chronic musculoskeletal conditions, and these cost the economy an estimated $55.1 billion annually.

Poor ergonomics can contribute to stiffness, fatigue, and discomfort, which makes work harder than it needs to be. The theme of Workspace Week is a timely reminder that prevention is the best protection. By making small, thoughtful adjustments, you can take proactive steps to support your body throughout the workday.

Simple Strategies to Try
------------------------

A healthier workspace doesn’t require an overhaul – just mindful changes:

*   Check that your screen is at eye level
*   Keep your feet flat on the floor
*   Take regular movement breaks to stretch or walk
*   Stay mindful of your posture throughout the day

Even these small adjustments can help reduce unnecessary strain and support focus and productivity.

Access Helpful Resources
------------------------

To help Australians make informed choices, the Australian Chiropractors Association has prepared fact sheets and checklists on topics such as sitting, standing, and lifting and bending correctly. These resources are filled with simple, practical advice that can be applied at home or in the office.

[Download the Fact Sheets and find additional information here](https://www.chiro.org.au/campaigns/workspace-week/)

Ready to Put These Tips Into Action?
------------------------------------

Making small changes to your daily setup is a smart starting point. If you’ve noticed ongoing tension in your back, neck, or shoulders, a chiropractor can assess your situation and offer tailored strategies to improve comfort and mobility.

Workspace Week is the perfect reminder to take charge of your habits and invest in long-term wellbeing. Don’t wait until discomfort slows you down – make changes today and feel the difference a healthier workspace can bring.

 is committed to providing whole-body [chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)

![Woman sitting at desk with neck pain](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/woman-at-desk-with-neck-pain-sq-400.jpg)Understanding the Source of Neck Discomfort
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People of all ages can experience neck pain, which may be related to a wide range of causes. Some individuals report localised discomfort, while others experience symptoms that may extend into the shoulders or arms. Headaches may also occur in certain cases, depending on the underlying contributing factors.

Common factors associated with neck discomfort include:

*   Whiplash or minor injuries
*   Prolonged sitting or desk work
*   Poor posture
*   Sleeping in an awkward position

Possible Effects of Neck Pain
-----------------------------

Neck pain may be accompanied by reduced movement, stiffness, muscle tenderness, or sensations such as tingling or numbness in the neck, shoulders, arms or hands. These effects can vary based on the nature and cause of the discomfort. Identifying contributing factors is an important step in developing a management approach.

How We Approach Care
--------------------

[Our chiropractors](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 provide manual therapy, including spinal adjustments, aimed at improving joint function and reducing associated symptoms. When certain joints are not moving as well as they should, this may contribute to local inflammation or muscular tension. Chiropractic care may assist in managing these symptoms by addressing joint restrictions and supporting musculoskeletal function.

Before any care is provided, your chiropractor will perform a thorough consultation, including a physical assessment and a review of your medical history. Based on this evaluation, we will discuss whether chiropractic care is suitable for your presentation and outline a recommended management plan.

Supporting Your Recovery
------------------------

In addition to in-practice care, we offer advice and strategies that may help support your recovery and overall wellbeing. For example, if your lifestyle includes extended periods of desk work, we can offer guidance on workstation setup and posture to help reduce physical strain. Our recommendations are tailored to your individual circumstances and aligned with your personal goals.

Your Personalised Management Plan
---------------------------------

Each person is different, and so is each management plan. If chiropractic care is considered appropriate for your situation, we’ll outline a plan that reflects your needs, preferences, and health objectives. Our practices use a combination of traditional and modern chiropractic techniques, and our team is committed to delivering care with professionalism and integrity.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

[What should I wear to my appointment?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/#toggle-1)

We recommend wearing comfortable, loose-fitting clothing. However, whatever you arrive in, our team will work with you to ensure your comfort during the visit.

[Are chiropractic adjustments safe?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/#toggle-2)

Chiropractic adjustments are generally considered safe when performed by a registered chiropractor. As with any healthcare treatment, there can be some risks, which your chiropractor will discuss with you before proceeding.

[Why is there a clicking sound during an adjustment?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/#toggle-3)

A clicking or popping sound can occur when a gas bubble is released within the joint space during an adjustment. This is a normal and common occurrence. Some people report feeling more relaxed or mobile afterward, though individual experiences can vary.

[Why might adjustments be recommended?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/#toggle-4)

Every person’s body and lifestyle are different. Certain habits, such as prolonged sitting, repetitive tasks, or physical strain, can contribute to joint or muscle discomfort. Chiropractic care aims to support joint function and mobility where appropriate.

[Will I receive treatment at the first visit?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/#toggle-5)

In most cases, treatment can begin during your first visit. However, your chiropractor will first complete a thorough assessment to ensure treatment is suitable and safe. If additional tests or referrals are needed, these will be discussed with you.

[Will I need X-rays?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/#toggle-6)

Most people do not require X-rays. A diagnosis and treatment plan can often be developed through a detailed history and physical examination. If imaging is needed, it can be arranged and bulk billed where appropriate.

[Can I use my private health insurance?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/#toggle-7)

Yes. We have TYRO available, allowing you to claim directly through your private health insurance provider (if chiropractic is included in your cover).

[Does chiropractic care hurt?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/#toggle-8)

Most chiropractic adjustments are not painful. Some muscle techniques may feel firm, but your chiropractor will always tailor care to your comfort level and discuss what to expect beforehand.

[How do I get to Biotune Chiropractic?](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/#toggle-9)

Osteoarthritis Care in Joondalup & Yanchep
==========================================

[Our chiropractors](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 at [Biotune Chiropractic](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)
 offer natural healthcare that considers your whole body, from head to toe. One common condition we often see is osteoarthritis, the most prevalent form of arthritis worldwide.

What Is Osteoarthritis?
-----------------------

![Older smiling woman outdoors](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/senior-woman-outdoors-smiling-sq-400.jpg)Osteoarthritis is a joint condition that occurs when the protective cartilage at the ends of bones gradually wears down over time. It can affect any joint but is most frequently found in the [hips](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/hip-and-lower-limb/)
, spine, hands, and [knees](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/knee-pain/)
. People with osteoarthritis often experience joint pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility.

While the joint changes caused by osteoarthritis cannot be reversed, symptom management is possible, helping you maintain a better quality of life.

Common Symptoms of Osteoarthritis
---------------------------------

Osteoarthritis usually develops gradually and may worsen over time. Symptoms can include:

*   A grating or grinding sensation in the joint
*   Reduced mobility and flexibility
*   Joint swelling and tenderness
*   Pain and stiffness
*   Numbness or discomfort in nearby areas

Symptoms often affect one side of the body more than the other and can impact daily activities and work over time.

Factors That May Worsen Osteoarthritis Symptoms
-----------------------------------------------

Certain activities or situations, such as prolonged sitting during long flights, drives, or at a desk, may increase discomfort. Pre-existing injuries or changes in weather can also influence symptoms.

How Chiropractic Care May Help
------------------------------

After a thorough evaluation, your chiropractor will discuss a personalised care plan tailored to your specific condition and needs.

[Chiropractic adjustments](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 aim to improve joint movement and support musculoskeletal function, which may help reduce discomfort and improve mobility. Soft tissue therapies can complement this by addressing muscles and connective tissues, potentially assisting with symptom relief.

In addition, your chiropractor can provide practical lifestyle advice, including workstation setup and sleep habits, tailored to your individual circumstances to help manage your symptoms.

Important Information
---------------------

Chiropractic care does not cure osteoarthritis or reverse joint damage, but may help you manage symptoms and support your overall musculoskeletal health.

Chiropractic Assessments for Infants in Joondalup & Yanchep
===========================================================

![Adjusting baby's back](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/infant-adjustment-on-spine-h.jpg)Caring for your baby’s physical development is essential, especially during the early stages of life. At [our practice](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)
, [Dr Matt Coxall (Principal Chiropractor)](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/dr-matt-coxall/)
 offers gentle chiropractic assessments focused on identifying musculoskeletal issues that may be affecting your baby’s comfort or movement. Dr Matt is available at both our Joondalup and Yanchep practices.

A Gentle, Age-Specific Approach
-------------------------------

A baby’s spine and nervous system are delicate and continue to develop rapidly in the first year of life. Sometimes, events such as the birthing process can place physical stress on an infant’s body, which may affect their musculoskeletal system.

Dr Matt uses gentle techniques, often involving light touch, to assess your baby’s spine, joints, and posture. Any hands-on care is carefully adapted for infants, using very minimal pressure, similar to checking the ripeness of a piece of fruit.

Why Parents Seek a Musculoskeletal Assessment
---------------------------------------------

Some parents choose to bring their baby in for a chiropractic assessment when they notice signs of possible musculoskeletal discomfort, such as:

*   Difficulty turning the head in one direction
*   Asymmetrical movement or posture
*   Seeming uncomfortable in certain positions
*   General unsettled behaviour that appears related to movement

It’s important to note that chiropractic care is not a treatment for medical conditions such as colic, reflux, digestive issues, or developmental delays. However, if musculoskeletal factors are contributing to your child’s discomfort or movement patterns, chiropractic care may form part of a broader support approach.

![Tiny baby](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/brand-new-baby-holding-finger-wide.jpg)

Our Approach to Evidence-Informed Care
--------------------------------------

[Dr Matt](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/dr-matt-coxall/)
 is experienced in working within a multi-disciplinary care model and may recommend co-management with other healthcare providers, such as paediatricians, lactation consultants, or maternal health nurses, where appropriate. Our priority is to provide safe, evidence-informed care tailored to your child’s individual needs.

All care decisions are made in consultation with parents or guardians, based on a thorough clinical assessment and informed consent.

Important Information for Parents
---------------------------------

Chiropractic care for infants is focused on assessing and supporting the musculoskeletal system. If you have concerns about your baby’s health, such as feeding difficulties, growth concerns, or developmental milestones, it is important to consult a qualified medical professional.

Care for Plantar Fasciitis in Joondalup & Yanchep
=================================================

At [Biotune Chiropractic](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)
, we provide [chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 that supports whole-body wellbeing. While chiropractic is often associated with spinal health, many people seek our care for a variety of musculoskeletal issues. One condition some patients inquire about is plantar fasciitis, a common source of foot and heel discomfort.

![Woman with pain in her foot](https://doc.vortala.com/childsites/uploads/2891/files/woman-with-foot-pain.jpg)What Is Plantar Fasciitis?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plantar fasciitis involves irritation or inflammation of the plantar fascia, a band of tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot. It’s often associated with heel pain that may feel worse in the morning or after periods of rest. Some individuals also notice discomfort when flexing the foot or toes upwards. A tight Achilles tendon may contribute to increased tension in the affected area.

Recognising the Signs
---------------------

Common signs of plantar fasciitis can include:

*   Sharp or aching pain in the heel or foot, especially when taking the first steps after rest
*   Discomfort that may improve with gentle movement
*   In some cases, sensations such as tingling, radiating discomfort, or mild swelling

It’s essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis, as other conditions can cause similar symptoms.

Supporting Foot and Biomechanical Health
----------------------------------------

[Chiropractors](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 are trained to assess the musculoskeletal system and may use manual techniques to address joint function, muscle tension, and body mechanics. While chiropractic care is not a treatment for plantar fasciitis specifically, some individuals with foot or lower limb concerns choose to explore chiropractic care as part of their broader health management.

Our approach may include:

*   Assessing overall posture and movement patterns
*   Addressing areas of joint restriction or muscle tension that could contribute to mechanical strain
*   Offering general advice on lifestyle habits, footwear, and ergonomic setup where relevant

Care recommendations are tailored to your specific needs and preferences. If appropriate, we may also suggest working alongside other healthcare providers such as podiatrists or physiotherapists.

What to Expect During Your Visit
--------------------------------

Your [first appointment](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/)
 will involve a thorough health history and physical examination. If chiropractic care is appropriate for your case, we will clearly explain your options and any recommendations. Care decisions are always made with your informed consent.

Flexible Appointment Options
----------------------------

We understand that your schedule can be busy, which is why we offer extended opening hours to accommodate your needs. Our aim is to provide timely and respectful care in a professional and supportive environment.

Contact Us

If you’re experiencing foot or heel discomfort and are wondering whether [chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 may be suitable as part of your management, please contact our team. We’re happy to answer your questions or arrange a time for an initial assessment.

Support for Poor Posture in Joondalup & Yanchep
===============================================

![Man and woman walking outdoors at sunset](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/couple-walking-at-sunset-sq-400.jpg)[Our team](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 at [Biotune Chiropractic](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)
 is committed to supporting your overall wellbeing. [Chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 may help manage symptoms associated with musculoskeletal conditions. In today’s digital age, many people spend extended time using mobile devices, computers, or tablets, which can contribute to poor posture across all age groups.

How Poor Posture Develops
-------------------------

Poor posture can begin early in life and often results from daily activities and habits. Factors such as occupation, sports, and lifestyle can influence posture. Prolonged stress or strain, especially related to work, may increase the likelihood of experiencing discomfort in areas such as the neck and shoulders.

Poor posture often involves muscle imbalances, including muscles that become tight, shortened, lengthened, or weakened. Regardless of how posture issues develop, we have the skills and experience to assess and assist you.

Recognising Poor Posture
------------------------

Poor posture doesn’t always mean slumping forward. Since body types and alignment vary between individuals, what is correct posture for one person might differ for another. Poor posture often relates to musculoskeletal changes in the neck, upper back, and lower back.

Some common signs include:

*   A forward-tilted pelvis
*   Rounded shoulders
*   A protruding neck and chin
*   Hump at base of neck

Contributing Factors to Poor Posture
------------------------------------

A forward pelvis may be caused by an exaggerated curve in the lower back, which can affect the position of abdominal organs. Rounded shoulders and neck posture issues may result from excessive curvature in the neck or mid-back.

Extended periods of sitting, whether at a desk, during travel, or at home, may worsen posture. Taking regular breaks to move can help reduce this effect. Pre-existing injuries, such as a disc bulge, may make maintaining good posture more challenging.

Starting Your Care
------------------

Your care begins with a thorough examination. During your [first appointment](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/)
, we will conduct a physical evaluation and review your health history to understand your needs. If chiropractic care is appropriate, we can perform adjustments aimed at improving joint function, including areas that may be compensating for your symptoms.

We will also provide advice on lifestyle factors, such as sleeping habits and workstation ergonomics, to support your recovery.

Take the First Step
-------------------

Contact us today to arrange your [initial consultation](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/)
 for posture-related concerns. Our friendly team is available with early and late opening hours to suit your schedule.

Pregnancy Chiropractic Care in Joondalup & Yanchep
==================================================

![webster technique adjustment](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/webster-technique-adjustment-h.jpg)Pregnancy is a time of significant physical and emotional change. Many women experience shifts in posture, joint mobility, and overall comfort as their bodies adapt. At Biotune Chiropractic we offer chiropractic care that is tailored to support your body’s natural changes during pregnancy.

Gentle Techniques for Expectant Mothers
---------------------------------------

As your pregnancy progresses, your body undergoes various changes that may influence your comfort and mobility. [Our chiropractors](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 use modified techniques that are gentle and considerate of these changes. We aim to support your musculoskeletal system throughout your prenatal journey, with care tailored to your stage of pregnancy and individual needs. We navigate around your changing body, focusing on making you as relaxed as possible.

![divider-dotted-1200](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/divider-dotted-1200.png)  
![Pregnant couple](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/pregnant-couple-relaxing-wide1.jpg)

Supporting You Throughout Your Pregnancy
----------------------------------------

Chiropractic care can be provided at all stages of pregnancy. During your [initial consultation](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/)
, we will take the time to understand your health history and any current concerns. Our approach is always personalised, and prenatal care is adjusted as needed throughout your pregnancy to support your comfort and mobility.

We use pregnancy-specific techniques where appropriate and avoid positions or adjustments that are not suitable during certain trimesters. Communication with your other healthcare providers is encouraged to ensure coordinated and appropriate care.

Postnatal Support for Your Comfort
----------------------------------

After childbirth, your body continues to change as it recovers and adapts to new physical demands. With your healthcare provider’s approval, chiropractic care may be used to support musculoskeletal function during the postnatal period. We also offer general advice on posture, gentle movement, and stretches that may help support your body during this time.

A Supportive Approach to Care
-----------------------------

Every pregnancy is unique. Our goal is to provide a safe and supportive environment where you feel heard and cared for. Chiropractic care at [Biotune Chiropractic](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)
 is offered as a complementary therapy to help support your comfort and overall wellbeing throughout your pregnancy and into the postnatal period.

Book an Appointment
-------------------

If you’re pregnant and interested in supportive chiropractic care, contact our practice to book a consultation. Our caring and experienced chiropractors are here to provide care tailored to your individual needs.

**Disclaimer:** Chiropractic care is a complementary therapy and does not replace medical or obstetric care. Please consult your GP or obstetrician regarding any health concerns during pregnancy.

Realistic Health Goals That You Can Actually Keep
=================================================

Health goals sound great on January 1…until life starts happening again. Work gets busy, sleep slips, routines get messy, and suddenly the plan feels impossible.

This year, consider choosing goals that are simple, flexible, and realistic—so you can keep them going long after the New Year buzz fades.

**Pick Goals That Fit Your Real Life**

A helpful goal is one that doesn’t require perfect conditions. Instead of aiming for a total routine overhaul, focus on habits you can repeat on your busiest week.

A good rule: if it feels “too much” to do daily, make it smaller until it feels doable.

**5 Health Goals You Can Reach (Without Burning Out)**

**1) Move a little every day**

This doesn’t have to be a workout. A short walk, stretching while the kettle boils, or a few mobility moves counts. Regular movement helps your body stay more comfortable and less tight.

**2) Improve one posture habit**

Choose just one. For example: keep your phone closer to eye level, adjust your chair support, or raise your laptop to reduce forward-head posture. Small changes here can reduce daily strain.

**3) Support your sleep routine**

Try one easy sleep anchor: a consistent wake-up time, less screen time before bed, or a wind-down routine that signals “off-duty” to your body.

**4) Drink more water (in a way that works)**

Instead of “8 glasses,” try linking water to habits you already do—one glass when you wake up, one with lunch, one mid-afternoon. Hydration supports your body’s natural balance and comfort.

**5) Add chiropractic care to your wellness plan  
**  
If your goal is to feel better in your body this year—less tightness, better movement, more ease day-to-day—chiropractic care can be a practical part of that plan. Many people find it helpful alongside movement, posture improvements, and better recovery habits.

**Keep It Simple**

The best health goals aren’t the most impressive ones—they’re the ones you can repeat. If you’d like support choosing a plan that fits your body and your schedule, reach out. We’re here with practical guidance and steady encouragement.

Sciatica Care in Joondalup & Yanchep
====================================

[Biotune Chiropractic](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)
 offers personalised care tailored to your individual musculoskeletal concerns. People often visit us with symptoms that may be related to sciatica, and we offer care that aims to support comfort, mobility, and function.

Understanding Sciatica-Like Symptoms
------------------------------------

![Chiropractor with female patient](https://doc.vortala.com/childsites/uploads/2891/files/dr-jill-mokrzycki-back-adjustment.png)Sciatica refers to irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve, which can cause discomfort that travels from the lower back into the leg. This discomfort may be due to a number of factors, including disc-related issues or muscular tension in the lower back or gluteal region. However, not all leg or back discomfort is due to sciatica, and a thorough assessment is needed to understand the cause.

Common Signs That May Be Associated with Sciatica
-------------------------------------------------

You may be experiencing the following:

*   Pain that travels into the leg, hip, buttock, thigh, or foot
*   Tingling or numbness in the lower extremities
*   Discomfort that may worsen with certain movements, such as bending or lifting
*   Increased symptoms during prolonged sitting

It’s important to note that symptoms vary between individuals, and not all people with nerve-related discomfort experience pain that extends to the foot.

What May Contribute to Sciatica-Like Discomfort
-----------------------------------------------

Various factors may aggravate sciatic nerve irritation, including prolonged sitting, physical strain, or repetitive movements. In some cases, pressure from surrounding muscles or structures may increase discomfort. The nature and progression of symptoms can depend on the underlying cause.

Chiropractic Support for Sciatica-Like Symptoms
-----------------------------------------------

[Chiropractors](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 use a variety of manual techniques to assess and manage musculoskeletal conditions. At our practice, we provide care that may assist with improving joint movement and relieving tension in surrounding muscles. This may contribute to reduced discomfort and improved function in some individuals.

Following a thorough consultation and physical examination, your chiropractor will discuss appropriate options for care based on your needs. We may also provide guidance on posture, ergonomics, and lifestyle factors that could support your recovery and general wellbeing.

Individualised Care Plans
-------------------------

Each person’s presentation is different. We focus on individualised care and work with you to determine the best approach. If [chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 is not suitable for your condition, we will advise you and may recommend referral to another health professional.

Schedule an Appointment
-----------------------

If you are experiencing symptoms that may relate to sciatica, contact our team to arrange a consultation. We provide flexible appointment times, including early mornings and evenings.

Shoulder Discomfort and Mobility Support in Joondalup & Yanchep
===============================================================

[Our practice](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)
 takes a holistic, movement-based approach to musculoskeletal care. Here, [our chiropractors](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 assess your posture, joint function, and movement patterns to help support your physical wellbeing and reduce discomfort related to joint or soft tissue strain.

Understanding the Shoulder Joint
--------------------------------

![Man with shoulder pain](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/radiating-shoulder-pain-sq-400.jpg)The shoulder is a complex joint made up of muscles, tendons, and fluid-filled sacs called bursae. These bursae help reduce friction during movement. When irritated, they can contribute to feelings of discomfort, stiffness, or restricted range of motion.

Shoulder irritation can result from repetitive overhead movements, physical stress, or posture-related strain, which is commonly seen in people engaged in activities like manual labour or racquet sports.

Common Symptoms People May Experience
-------------------------------------

While shoulder discomfort can vary, people often report:

*   A dull ache in the front or side of the shoulder
*   Discomfort during or after activity
*   Increased pain at night
*   A feeling of weakness or reduced range of motion

If symptoms include redness, swelling, or a sudden loss of function, we recommend seeking medical attention to rule out more serious conditions.

How Chiropractic Care May Support You
-------------------------------------

[Our chiropractors](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 provide thorough assessments to understand your musculoskeletal presentation. If [chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 is considered appropriate, we may use manual techniques such as:

*   Gentle joint adjustments to address restricted movement
*   Soft tissue techniques to help reduce muscular tension
*   Postural or ergonomic advice tailored to your lifestyle

We do not diagnose or treat medical conditions, but some individuals report improvements in comfort and function when mechanical imbalances are addressed as part of a broader wellness approach.

Lifestyle Advice and Prevention
-------------------------------

We may also provide advice on sleep positions and pillow support, as well as desk and workstation ergonomics, and modifying repetitive activities to reduce shoulder strain. Our goal is to support your mobility and help reduce the risk of future flare-ups.

Discover Convenient, Personalised Care
--------------------------------------

We offer early and late appointment times to suit your schedule. Whether you’re looking to maintain your physical health or seeking support for a specific concern, our team is here to provide patient-centred care in a relaxed, professional environment.

Book your appointment at Biotune Chiropractic today to find out if chiropractic care may be suitable for your needs.

Soft Tissue Therapy in Joondalup
================================

![](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/back-chiropractic-adjustment-h.jpeg)  
[Our chiropractors](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 use a comprehensive approach that combines [chiropractic adjustments](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 with a variety of soft tissue techniques. This integrated style of care may help ease discomfort, support recovery, and make everyday movement feel easier and more comfortable.

Soft tissue therapy focuses on the muscles, ligaments, and connective tissues that support your joints and spine. When combined with precise chiropractic adjustments, these methods can assist with flexibility, reduce tension, and encourage better body function.

Techniques We Use
-----------------

###   
Activator Method®

This technique uses a small handheld spring-loaded device called an Activator® to deliver a gentle impulse to specific areas of the spine or extremities. It is designed to support nervous system balance and musculoskeletal comfort.

###   
Diversified Technique

A widely used chiropractic approach, Diversified focuses on restoring spinal alignment and improving joint mobility. Through careful, hands-on adjustments, this technique aims to reduce stiffness and encourage natural movement.

###   
Dry Needling

[Dry needling](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/dry-needling/)
 involves inserting fine sterile needles into muscle trigger points to help relieve tension and improve muscle performance. It is often used to support recovery and mobility in people with musculoskeletal discomfort.

###   
Gua Sha

This soft tissue technique uses a smooth handheld tool to massage the muscles and fascia. Gua Sha helps improve circulation, ease tension, and may assist with discomfort linked to repetitive use.

###   
Sacro Occipital Technique (SOT®)

SOT® focuses on the connection between the pelvis, spine, and skull to encourage balance and comfort. Chiropractors use gentle adjustments and specialised supports to promote better alignment.

###   
Thompson Drop Table Technique

This method uses a specially designed chiropractic table with padded platforms that drop slightly during an adjustment. The light motion assists gentle spinal adjustments with minimal force.

###   
Trigger Point Therapy

Trigger Point Therapy targets tight or sensitive areas in the muscles. By applying sustained pressure with the fingers, thumbs, or elbows, these points are encouraged to release, which may help ease discomfort and restore flexibility.

Supporting Whole-Body Wellness
------------------------------

Each soft tissue and chiropractic technique is selected based on your individual needs, comfort level, and health goals. By combining these evidence-informed methods, our chiropractors aim to support your body’s natural ability to move and function at its best.

Schedule an appointment at [Biotune Chiropractic](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)

Tennis Elbow Care in Joondalup & Yanchep
========================================

[Our practice](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/about-us/)
 provides patient-centred care informed by current best practices in chiropractic and musculoskeletal health. If you’re experiencing elbow discomfort, we’ll take the time to understand your symptoms and determine whether [chiropractic care](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/chiropractic-care/)
 may be suitable for your needs.

![Man holding elbow in pain](https://doc.vortala.com/static/uploads/9/files/man-in-plaid-holding-elbow-sq-400.jpg)What Is Tennis Elbow?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tennis elbow, or lateral epicondylitis, is a condition that causes pain on the outer part of the elbow. It’s often related to repetitive wrist and arm movements that can place stress on the tendons of the forearm.

Common Symptoms may include:

*   Pain or tenderness on the outside of the elbow
*   Difficulty gripping or lifting objects
*   Discomfort when shaking hands or turning a doorknob
*   Weakness in the forearm
*   Pain that may radiate down to the wrist

Symptoms may worsen with activities such as typing, racquet sports, manual work, or lifting.

Can Chiropractic Care Help With Tennis Elbow?
---------------------------------------------

At your [first appointment](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/new-patients/)
, [our chiropractors](https://www.biotunechiropractic.com.au/meet-the-team/)
 will conduct a thorough history and physical assessment. If your symptoms are consistent with tennis elbow and chiropractic care appears appropriate, we’ll discuss a care plan tailored to your needs.

We may use a combination of gentle manual techniques, soft tissue work to support surrounding areas, and advice on posture, ergonomics, and activity modification.

Our goal is to support your musculoskeletal health and movement. If your condition requires care outside our scope, we will refer you to the appropriate health professional.

A Whole-Body Approach
---------------------

Tennis elbow can be influenced by how the joints in your shoulder, neck, and wrist function. We assess the whole body to identify contributing factors and support overall biomechanics, which may help reduce strain on the affected area.

Lifestyle and Self-Care Advice
------------------------------

We’ll also offer practical advice that may help reduce symptoms and prevent recurrence, such as:

*   Ergonomic workstation setup
*   Posture tips
*   Sleep positioning and pillow selection
*   Activity modification strategies

Your Nervous System 101: Understanding How Your Body Responds to Stress
=======================================================================

Ever felt wired but exhausted? Or maybe you find it hard to relax even after a long day? That may have more to do with your nervous system than you think.

**Meet Your Two Modes**

Your body’s nervous system has two main settings: the sympathetic (commonly known as “fight or flight”) and the parasympathetic (“rest and digest”). The sympathetic system prepares you to respond to stress, while the parasympathetic helps you calm down and recover. Both are important, but spending too much time in a heightened state can lead to tension, poor sleep, or feeling on edge.

**Everyday Stress Adds Up**

Modern life tends to keep us in a go-go-go state. Whether it’s juggling work, family, or constant notifications, your nervous system can get stuck in overdrive. This might show up as jaw clenching, tight shoulders, shallow breathing, or trouble falling asleep. You may not even realise how tense you are until someone points it out!

**Simple Ways to Support Balance**

The good news? Small daily choices can support a more balanced nervous system. Gentle movement, deep breathing, and regular sleep patterns all help shift your body into a calmer state. Setting boundaries around screen time, creating a wind-down routine, or spending time outdoors are also useful ways to invite in more “rest and digest” moments.

**Tuning In Is Step One**

Your nervous system is always working in the background to keep you regulated. Learning how to recognise its signals – and support it with healthy habits – can lead to noticeable changes in how you feel physically and emotionally.

Not sure where to start? We’re here to help you tune in and feel more supported. Just reach out anytime for practical, personalised guidance.
